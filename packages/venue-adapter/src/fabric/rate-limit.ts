/**
 * THE PER-VENUE RATE-LIMIT GOVERNOR — §27's "rate-limit governor per venue".
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS IS A SAFETY DEVICE AND NOT AN OPTIMISATION
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Getting banned by a venue mid-execution is an outage you caused yourself, and
 * it is the worst-timed outage available: rate limits bite hardest in a fast
 * market, which is exactly when there are open orders that need cancelling and
 * a position that needs hedging. A venue that has IP-banned us for ten minutes
 * looks, from inside the process, identical to a venue that has gone down —
 * except we did it, and we did it while holding risk.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE GOVERNOR NEVER SLEEPS ON THE CALLER'S BEHALF
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `tryAcquire` returns a DECISION. It does not await, it does not queue, and it
 * does not hold a promise open until a token frees up.
 *
 * A governor that silently waits converts a rate limit into latency, and latency
 * with no upper bound is worse than a refusal: the caller believes it is
 * executing, the market moves, and the order finally goes out against a price
 * that no longer exists. A refusal is honest — the venue is `rate_limited`,
 * which §27 requires be EXCLUDED AND REPORTED, and the router routes around it
 * with the reason attached.
 *
 * A caller that genuinely can wait (a background market refresh) reads
 * `retryAfterMs` and schedules. A caller that cannot (an execution path) treats
 * the refusal as the exclusion it is.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * HEADROOM, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT THE ONLY CLIENT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Venue limits are per IP or per key, and neither is per process. Another pod,
 * a backfill job, or a user's own bot on the same key all spend from the same
 * bucket. A governor tuned to exactly the published limit is a governor that
 * bans us the first time anything else is running.
 *
 * `reservedHeadroomBps` is the fraction we refuse to spend. It defaults to
 * 20% and is not optional, because the failure it prevents is invisible in
 * testing — you only find out in production, with everything else running.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE VENUE'S OWN VERDICT OUTRANKS OUR ARITHMETIC
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * When a venue answers 429 or 418, our model of its limit has already been
 * proven wrong. `observeVenueBackoff` drains the bucket and hard-blocks until
 * the venue says otherwise. Continuing to spend tokens we believe we have,
 * against a venue that has just told us to stop, is how a soft limit becomes a
 * ban.
