# Bizzan / CoinExchange — peace-of-mind map

**Type:** scope truth for agents + Nitro  
**Verified against:** `origin/main` @ `d768d7c` (2026-08-03 this session)  
**Upstream name:** CoinExchange / bitrade / Bizzan lineage · Apache-2.0 · in-repo as `vendor/coinexchange`  
**Product law:** adopt product UI + workflows; **our ledger only** (ADR Accepted 2026-08-02)

## One screen (read this first)

| Question | Answer |
| -------- | ------ |
| What is “Bizzan” here? | The **vendored full exchange kit** under `vendor/coinexchange` (~**1,787** files on main). |
| Is it on GitHub? | **Yes** — on `main`. Source of truth is the **repo**, not a laptop or random web copy. |
| What do we use as the product UI? | **`05_Web_Front`** (trader web) → fleet port **:8090** (`vendor-shell` in compose). |
| Is the whole upstream promise in our tree? | **Almost.** Web front, web admin, Java engines, wallet RPC, docs = **present**. **Android, iOS, trading robot = stubs only** (upstream said not open-source / not included). |
| Is anything “missing” from our vision? | **Yes, by design:** own L1/chain story, our TypeScript services, our ledger books, Protocol plane, spiritual/G-master — those are **ours**, not Bizzan. |
| Second app? | `apps/web` (Next, :3000) is **not** the product. Retire as product. |
| Who owns FE? | **Nitro** (call 2026-08-03). |

## What’s in the kit (full folder map)

| Folder | On main? | What it is | FE care? |
| ------ | -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| **`05_Web_Front`** | **Yes** (~262 files, **74** `.vue`) | Trader website: trade, OTC, account, CMS, activity, + our `intafaced/*` stubs | **Primary** |
| **`04_Web_Admin`** | **Yes** (~156 files, **~92** `.vue`) | Operator / admin console | Later FE if Nitro takes admin look |
| **`00_framework`** | **Yes** (~912 files) | Java microservices: exchange, market, OTC, ucenter, admin, chat, wallet, cloud, jobs | Denon / adapters — not FE rewrite |
| **`01_wallet_rpc`** | **Yes** (~359 files) | Per-chain wallet RPC (btc, eth, usdt, eos, … + rpc-common) | **Not FE.** Security review before real money |
| **`09_DOC`** | **Yes** (~74 files) | Upstream screenshots / nginx notes | Reference only |
| **`02_App_Android`** | **Stub only** (README: not open-sourced) | No app source in repo | Out of scope until we decide mobile |
| **`03_APP_IOS`** | **Stub only** | Same | Same |
| **`06_ExchangeRobot`** | **Stub only** | Same | Out of scope |
| Root scripts | Yes | rebrand / CJK / seed helpers used in our waves | Tooling |

**Provenance (must stay):** `vendor/coinexchange/NOTICE` — Apache-2.0 attribution; external brand stripped by `brand-scan`.

**Vendored into this monorepo:** PR **#73** (2026-07-28). Shell made **deployable** PR **#412** (+ follow-on container fixes).

## Trader shell (`05_Web_Front`) — screen inventory

**~43 page entry files** under `src/pages/` (plus shared components → **74** Vue files total).

| Area | Count (page files) | Examples |
| ---- | -----------------: | -------- |
| **uc** (account / auth) | 7 | Login, Register, MemberCenter, FindPwd, … |
| **otc** (C2C / P2P desk) | 6 | Main, Trade, Chat, AdPublish, … |
| **cms** | 6 | Help, Notice, AboutUs, WhitePaper, … |
| **activity** | 4 | Activity, Partner, Bzb, … |
| **exchange** | 1 | `Exchange.vue` (big trading terminal) |
| **index / invite / ctc / envelope** | 1 each | Home, invite, CTC, red envelope |
| **intafaced/** (our overlays) | 13 | Academy, Bank, Dex, Pay, Protocol, Chain, Token, NotBuilt, … |
| **NotFound** | 1 | |

**Deploy on main (verified):**  
- `Dockerfile` + `nginx.conf`  
- Compose service **`vendor-shell`** → **`8090:80`**, proxies `/api` and `/ws` toward our edge stack  

**Runnable ≠ finished:** many screens still need **rewire** to our edge (work in progress / open PRs). Catch-all routes can show home for bad URLs — verify by real navigation.

## What the law says (agent pack)

Load these for any FE / Bizzan work (all **on main** except starred):

| Doc | Role |
| --- | ---- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Repo agent rules, Nitro operator mode |

| `INTAFACED SOVEREIGN OS.pdf` | Product vision (features) |

### Ownership freeze (2026-08-03)

| Lane | Owner |
| ---- | ----- |
| Trader / product **frontend** (shell) | **Nitro** |
| Pay / perps / checkout (claimed) | **Shehzad** — agents do not implement |
| Spine / Java / recipes / deploy wiring | **Denon** (move free; don’t dual-edit his open PRs) |
| Secrets / wallet-RPC real-value | **Owner** + security review |

---

## Adoption buckets (so “use Bizzan” is not vague)

From adoption queue (branch; counted, not vibes):

| Bucket | Meaning | Scale (approx) |
| ------ | ------- | -------------- |
| **1 ADOPT AS-IS** | No balance write — stop rebuilding | **68** framework controllers |
| **2 ADOPT + ADAPT** | Keep logic; redirect balance → ledger | **25** money controllers |
| **3 REWIRE** | Keep **screen**; point at our edge | UI work — Nitro-relevant |
| **4 DELETE** | Dead weight | Justified file-by-file |
| **5 REPLACE** | Cannot run beside ours | Balance book + named collisions |
| **Wallet RPC** | Adopt after **security review** | **14** controllers; 6 modules auth hole flagged |

**Money doors on Java side are largely shut** (no-ops + 410 interceptor) until opened behind ledger adapters — Denon queue.

---

## What’s *not* Bizzan (ours / later)

| Item | Where it lives |
| ---- | -------------- |
| One real book | `packages/ledger-*`, our services |
| Edge, identity, pay TS services | `services/svc-*` |
| `apps/web` Next surface | Retire as product; optional port later |
| Own L1 / Hyperliquid-class chain story | Not in vendor kit |
| G-master / spiritual / ancient intelligence | Explicitly **later** (call) |
| Casino games provider API | Denon: mostly done elsewhere |
| Full native mobile apps | **Not in repo** (stubs) |
| Full trading robot source | **Not in repo** (stub) |

## “Is everything on GitHub?” checklist

| Check | Result `[VERIFIED this session]` |
| ----- | -------------------------------- |
| Vendor tree on `origin/main` | **Yes** · ~1787 files |
| Trader shell Dockerfile + :8090 compose | **Yes** |
| Admin Vue app present | **Yes** |
| Java framework modules present | **Yes** (admin, exchange, market, otc, ucenter, …) |
| Wallet RPC tree present | **Yes** |
| Android/iOS/robot full source | **No** — stubs + “not open source” READMEs |
| Adoption queue doc on main | **No** — still branch `docs/bizzan-adoption-queue` |
| Call extract docs on main | **No** — local only until committed |
| Open FE-related PR (at check) | **#418** rewire OTC/identity/inbox (Denon) · **#346** Shehzad pay (not FE shell) |

**Nothing important for the trader web product is “only on Denon’s machine” for the kit itself.** Unmerged work lives as **PRs/branches** (normal). Re-fetch before every coding session.

## Agent cold-start (copy into FE chats)

```
Product UI = vendor/coinexchange/05_Web_Front (:8090). apps/web is not product.
Law: adopt vendored product, ledger.* only book. Nitro owns frontend.
Read: docs/BIZZAN-PEACE-OF-MIND-MAP-2026-08-03.md + AGENTS.md + ADR 2026-08-02.
Do not implement Shehzad pay/perps paths. Do not dual-edit Denon open vendor PRs without check.
git fetch && worktree off origin/main — never edit main checkout.
Near-horizon only. TradingView preferred for charts (Denon).
```

## Next after this map (Chat B / D)

- **B:** Redundant vs port (`apps/web` + past craft vs shell).  
- **D:** FE task board + ship on shell.  
- **C landscape:** only if a **named gap** appears; do not re-pick white-labels.

---

*Re-verify tip: `git fetch && git rev-parse --short origin/main` and re-list open PRs before claiming this map’s open-PR row still exact.*
