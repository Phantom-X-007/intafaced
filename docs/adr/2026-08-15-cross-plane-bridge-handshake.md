# D26-P4-02 — Cross-plane bridge handshake (ledger ↔ chain · who signs)

**Status:** Handshake recorded — 2026-08-15. **Does not** implement `svc-bridge`, protocol, or chain.
**Board:** D26-P4-02 (`docs/DENON-HARD-PARALLEL-BOARD-2026-08-09.md` §8).
**Lane:** `denon-d26-p4-02-bridge-handshake`.
**Accounting law (already accepted):** [`docs/adr/2026-08-04-cross-plane-bridge-accounting.md`](2026-08-04-cross-plane-bridge-accounting.md) (D-S-12).
**Chain side (Shehzad, not this PR):** S-B5 (bridge design) · S-D7 (`svc-bridge`) · S-B3 (IFC on-chain representation) · tracker `bridge.canonical` owner `shehzad002`.
**Guardian law (already accepted):** [`docs/adr/2026-08-08-inheritance-never-platform-guardian.md`](2026-08-08-inheritance-never-platform-guardian.md) · `socket.social-recovery`.
**Tip at write:** `1723273b`. Re-derive before acting.

This note is the Denon ↔ Shehzad handshake: **one supply across two planes**, and **who may sign**. It names open questions. It does not invent attestation keys, mint-vs-lock, confirmation depth, or a rail.

## 1 · One supply

Doctrine §17.3: ledger IFC and chain IFC are **one supply**, reconciled by the bridge + attestations.

That conservation is **not** `totalsByAsset === 0` on the Fiat book. D-S-12 already settled this: the ledger cannot see the chain; citing the book as cross-plane proof is forbidden. The number that would matter is `-balance(treasury/bridge:<chain>, asset)` against the on-chain locked or minted figure — **not computed today**, because `bridgeBoundary()` has no callers and no service may read both books in one place.

Until the D-S-12 reconciler exists **and** Shehzad's on-chain figure exists, **no crossing is enabled**.

## 2 · Two languages — do not mix them

A crossing is two legs on two systems (D-S-12). Each leg speaks a different language.

| Plane                         | What moves value                                                                                          | What must never be treated as the other                          |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fiat / custodial**          | `packages/ledger-client` **recipes** posted through `LedgerClient.post`                                   | A chain log, a bus event, or adapter memory                      |
| **Protocol / self-custody**   | **Protocol / chain events** that are **final** (reorg-safe source), plus attestation when that design lands | A ledger posting, `totalsByAsset`, or `svc-protocol` first-seen observation |

**Custodial recipes (named, not written).** D-S-12 keys: `bridge.<direction>.hold:<crossingId>` then `bridge.<direction>.settle:<crossingId>` **or** `bridge.<direction>.reverse:<crossingId>`. Precedent is `withdrawHold` / `withdrawSettle` / `withdrawReverse` in `packages/ledger-client/src/recipes/index.ts`. The seam account is already `bridgeBoundary(chain, asset)` → `treasury` / `bridge:<chain>`. **No `bridge.*` recipe exists on this tip.** Agents do not invent one in this handshake.

**Protocol events (consume, do not author here).** `packages/events` already reserves verb `'attested'` with no publisher. D-S-12: `svc-protocol` publishes from the first log seen — acceptable for observation, **forbidden as a bridge input**. A bridge consumes `svc-indexer`'s reorg-safe source or it consumes nothing. Shehzad owns the chain facts (S-B5 / S-D7). Agents do not open `svc-protocol` or Solidity to "complete" this handshake.

---

## 3 · Who signs (the rule)

**Settled — do not re-litigate:**

1. **The user signs for self-custody.** `SmartAccount` accepts one unrestricted signer: the user's `owner`. The platform holds no key the account recognises (svc-protocol README; doctrine §17.4 session keys never include withdrawal).
2. **The platform posts the custodial book as bookkeeper, not as chain signer.** Ledger recipes are operator/service posts against `treasury/bridge:<chain>`. That is double-entry. It is **not** a guardian signature on the user's smart account, **not** a mint/lock on-chain, and **not** an attestation vote.
3. **The platform is never a guardian.** A guardian is a second party who can take the account. No platform-controlled key is eligible; no platform quorum may move user chain funds. If a bridge or recovery design requires the platform to be that party, it **stays a socket** (`socket.social-recovery` · S-K7 ADR).
4. **Window exposure is the platform's, never the user's** (D-S-12 §3). Crash between legs: user spendable must not show value that has left; treasury carries the obligation.

**Not a signature:** watching a log, publishing a bus event, or storing adapter memory. Those are observations. Chain state after finality is the authority for the protocol leg (D-S-12 §4–§5).

## 4 · Open questions (named, not invented)

These stay open. This handshake does not pick them.

| ID | Question                                                                                         | Who answers                                      | Status on tip                                                                                          |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Q1 | Mint vs lock for IFC on the rail (how the chain figure is defined)                               | Shehzad S-B3                                     | Unanswered. Spec ADR first if ambiguous.                                                               |
| Q2 | Attestation design, signer set, quorum                                                           | Shehzad S-B5                                     | **Zero of the keys a crossing needs exist today** (D-S-12). Verb `'attested'` is reserved, unpublished. |
| Q3 | Confirmation depth / finality number for a bridge                                                | Shehzad + D-S-12 implementers                    | Neither number exists in-repo for a bridge. Name it with a written reason before settle.               |
| Q4 | Which EVM rail carries Protocol P0                                                               | Nitro (§0.5) via S-D1                            | Proposed in the P0 handshake ADR; not a Denon pick here.                                               |
| Q5 | `jurisdiction.ts` `bridge: OPEN_FULL` — confirm KYC tier for a crossing                          | Owner (D-S-12 "what still needs the owner")      | Silent today; restated here as still needing a deliberate confirm.                                     |
| Q6 | Register the bridge as a human / Class X blocker                                                 | Nitro human                                      | Class X1 (plausibly X3) go-live. Not agent-done.                                                       |
| Q7 | Cross-plane reconciler (first deliverable before any crossing)                                   | Ledger plane (D-S-12 agents may implement)       | Not built. Halt-on-divergence is the gate.                                                             |

Until Q2 lands, D-S-12 stands: **a crossing is operator-gated or it does not run.** Operator-gated is not "platform as guardian." It is refuse-closed until attestation or an explicit operator gate exists. Agents do not invent multisig / optimistic / light-client theatre (S-B5).

## 5 · Split of work (handshake, not fight)

`bridge.canonical` stays `owner: shehzad002`. This docs handshake does **not** claim that mountain.

## 6 · Non-goals (this PR)

- No `svc-protocol`, no Solidity, no Vue, no `svc-edge`, no `owner-ruling-packet.json`.
- No `svc-bridge` service, tables, events, or tests.
- No invented attestation security, signer list, or confirmation depth.
- Does not re-open D-S-12. The accounting ADR remains the law this handshake points at.
