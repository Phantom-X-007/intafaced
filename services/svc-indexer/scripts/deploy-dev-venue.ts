/**
 * Deploy the DevVenue fixture to the local dev chain, and print what to set.
 *
 *   docker compose up -d evm
 *   pnpm --filter @intafaced/svc-indexer chain:deploy
 *
 * This exists so a developer can watch the read model fill up against a real
 * chain, not because anything deploys this contract for real. `DevVenue` has no
 * access control at all — anyone can publish any trade they like — so
 * `deployDevVenue` refuses on any endpoint that does not identify itself as a
 * throwaway anvil/hardhat node on the dev chain id.
 *
 * The address is deterministic while the `evm` service holds no volume: a
 * restart gives a genesis-fresh chain, the deployer's nonce is 0 again, and the
 * contract lands at the same address every time. That is what lets
 * docker-compose.apps.yml name it as a default instead of making every developer
 * copy hex out of a terminal.
