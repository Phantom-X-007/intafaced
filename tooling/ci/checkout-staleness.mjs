/**
 * checkout-staleness — how far behind origin/main this working copy is.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is worth its own file:
 * a board generated from a stale checkout reports work that does not exist.
 * Measured on 2026-08-06 (#958): a checkout 178 commits behind reported
 * `freeImplementable=6 blocked=0` while origin/main reported `0` and `15`.
 * An agent reading the stale board spawns workers onto work that is gone.
 *
 * This used to live inside thrift-preflight. Thrift was deleted on 2026-08-07
 * (the repo is public; Actions are free; the bill it metered does not exist).
 * The staleness guard survived the deletion because it never had anything to
 * do with spend — it is the one honest thing that file did.
 *
 * Fails open: no git, no origin ref, or a detached state returns null. A
 * guard that crashes the tool it guards is worse than no guard.
