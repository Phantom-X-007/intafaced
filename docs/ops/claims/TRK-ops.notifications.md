# Claim TRK-ops.notifications

**status:** merged
**owner:** cursor-swarm-notify
**slice:** residual-N
**proof:** #991 merged 2026-08-07 — persist mute prefs so restarts cannot silently unmute
**tip:** feat/ops-notifications-residual

> `swarm:freeze` kept reporting this mountain as owned by a session that no longer exists.
> Residual noted above (if any) is unchanged and still real — closing the claim closes the
> SLICE, not the mountain. Mountain state lives in `tooling/tracker/features.mjs`.
