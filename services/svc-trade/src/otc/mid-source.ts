/**
 * OTC reference mid port (trade.otc / SPEC-OTC-RFQ-AND-EARN Part A).
 *
 * The mid a quote is priced off is **server-sourced**. It is never read from
 * the caller.
 *
 * "Never invent a mid" is a rule about where a price may come from, not only
 * about refusing to make one up: a desk that prices at a number the taker
 * chose has not avoided inventing a price, it has outsourced the invention to
 * the one party with a reason to get it wrong. The taker names the size and
 * the side; the desk names the price, or there is no quote.
 *
 * Null → `trade.otc_no_reference_price`. A dark feed is a refusal, never a
 * fallback and never a stale number.
 *
 * Every usable mid carries `asOf` — when the price was OBSERVED, not when it
 * was read. The desk law's owner-published `maxMidAgeSeconds` decides when an
 * observation is still a price rather than a memory (DIRECTION §8 — never
 * invented here).
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT reuse `mm/mid-source.ts`, whose config source is
 * the same handful of lines: that module reaches `venue-contracts` and
 * `futures/mark-source`, and importing it here would pull the venue fabric and
 * the futures graph into a desk that needs neither. When a published desk
 * wants live venue mids, chain a second source in front of this one rather
 * than widening the import.
