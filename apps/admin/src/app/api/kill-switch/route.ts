/**
 * The console's own kill-switch endpoint (§14.6).
 *
 * A thin server-side hop, and the thinness is the point:
 *
 *   · The operator credential stays on the server. A board that called
 *     `svc-edge` from the browser would have to ship `ADMIN_OPERATOR_TOKEN` to
 *     the browser, and a token carrying `admin:write` in a bundle is a token in
 *     everybody's devtools.
 *   · It gives §14.6's "reachable from `apps/admin`" something concrete to mean.
 *     A test that called `svc-edge` directly would prove the edge works while
 *     proving nothing about this app.
 *
 * No authentication of its own, and that is the console's known gap rather than
 * a new one: `apps/admin/README.md` has said since it was written that this app
 * must sit behind operator SSO before it is deployed anywhere reachable. It is
 * repeated here because this is the first route in the console that can change
 * the platform, so it is the first one where the gap costs something.
