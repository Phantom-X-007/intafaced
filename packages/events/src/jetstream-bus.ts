/**
 * The last attempt has just failed — say so, once, before the bus goes quiet.
 *
 * WHAT "PARKED FOR THE OPERATOR" USED TO MEAN
 *
 * Nothing. `SubscribeOptions.maxDeliver` said "before the message goes to the
 * dead-letter subject", and there is no dead-letter subject — the phrase
 * appeared exactly once in this repo, in that sentence. JetStream simply stops
 * redelivering: no subject, no row, no log, no advisory consumer. A margin call
 * that failed its whole budget left the same trace as one that was never
 * published, and the only "operator" who could have been reading was a NATS
 * advisory nobody subscribes to.
 *
 * So this is not a dead-letter queue and does not pretend to be one. Publishing
 * to a new subject would mean inventing one in the catalog, which is a decision
 * and not a bug fix. This is the smallest true thing: the moment the bus gives
 * up is the moment somebody is told, with enough to find the message — subject,
 * durable, attempt count, and the envelope's own idempotency key, which is what
 * a replay would be keyed on.
 *
 * `console.error` because this package deliberately depends on no logger and
 * chooses none for its consumers. A structured line on a path that should never
 * run beats a silence that always looks healthy.
 *
 * Fail-safe: this must never be why a message is not nak'd, so every part of it
 * that could throw — decoding a payload that already failed to parse — is
 * caught and dropped in favour of reporting less.

 * THE DRIFT THIS CLOSES

 * `subscribe()` called `consumers.add()` and stopped there. A durable consumer
 * is created once and then lives in the server; `add` on one that already
 * exists does not apply the config it was handed — it either refuses or returns
 * the config the server already had. So `max_deliver` and `ack_wait` were
 * whatever the FIRST boot of that durable asked for, permanently, and changing
 * either in this file had no effect on any deployment past its first.
 *
 * `ensureStream` below has always done the other thing — catch "already exists"
 * and call `streams.update`, "in case the registry grew". Streams reconciled on
 * every boot; consumers never did. That asymmetry was the bug.
 *
 * It matters beyond tidiness because other services compute bounds against
 * these numbers. `svc-notify`'s README requires `NOTIFY_MAX_DELIVERY_ATTEMPTS`
 * to sit "at or below the bus maxDeliver", and the delivery row that retires a
 * spent margin call depends on that relationship holding. A live consumer with
 * a stale `max_deliver` makes that bound a statement about a number nobody is
 * using.
 *
 * Reconciled by COMPARISON rather than by catching an error, because the two
 * possible behaviours of `add` on an existing durable — refuse, or hand back
 * the stale config — need the same correction and only one of them throws.
 * `filter_subject` is deliberately not reconciled: JetStream does not accept it
 * in an update, and it is derived from the event name, so it cannot drift
 * without the durable name drifting too.
