/**
 * Environment for svc-indexer.
 *
 * Note what this service does NOT need, and must never acquire:
 *
 *   · no signing key of any kind. A read model originates no transaction, so
 *     there is nothing here for a key to authorise (§16.10)
 *   · no ledger connection, and no `LEDGER_URL`. This plane posts nothing —
 *     `custody-scan` asserts it, and `sovereignty.test.ts` asserts it again
 *   · no write credentials against any other service's schema (§2)
 *
 * If a future change adds a private key or a ledger URL to this file, that
 * change is either wrong or belongs in svc-bridge, which is custodial by design
 * (§17.3).
 *
 * `EDGE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET` is here because this service self-mounts `/trpc`
 * (docs/decisions/mount-boundary.md). Every read procedure is permissionless,
 * so the secret authorises nothing — but the mount recipe is the mount recipe,
 * and a service that cannot tell an edge-vouched principal from a caller-typed
 * one should not be the service that decides it does not need to.
