/**
 * THE PAYOUT BOUND — realised futures profit is bounded by a real balance.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT WAS WRONG
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `futuresRealizeProfit` pays a winning position out of `houseFees('trade', …)`
 * with no ceiling. A house account is not an insurance fund and a fee balance is
 * not a risk budget: the size of the platform's worst day was whatever had
 * happened to accumulate in a fee pot, and nothing in the code said so.
 *
 * `bank.pool_underfunded` is the model — "a pool that cannot pay its advertised
 * rate is an operator problem today, not a shortfall discovered at maturity."
 * The equivalent here is that an under-funded profit source is an operator
 * problem at the moment of the trade, not an accounting surprise later.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND DELIBERATELY IS NOT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It is THE MECHANISM: profit is paid from a NAMED account, that account's
 * balance is the ceiling, and a payout that would exceed it refuses instead of
 * overdrawing.
 *
 * It is NOT the choice of account, and it sets no rate, ceiling or buffer.
 * `docs/adr/2026-08-05-futures-risk-and-mark-law.md` reserves "which account
 * funds realised profit, and how it is capitalised" to the owner — it is a fee
 * and revenue recipe, `DIRECTION` §8 item 6 and a §3 carve-out twice over. So
 * the account arrives as CONFIGURATION and there is no default. A deployment
 * that has not named one does not quietly fall back to house fees.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT "REFUSE" MEANS — AND WHAT IT COST WHEN IT MEANT THE WRONG THING
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It used to mean REFUSE TO BOOT. `index.ts` called `profitSourceFromConfig` at
 * module scope, `.env.example` shipped the variable commented out, and compose
 * passed `${TRADE_FUTURES_PROFIT_SOURCE:-}`. So `pnpm platform:up` from a clean
 * clone crash-looped svc-trade — and svc-trade is not "the futures service", it
 * is spot orders, ticker, orderbook, balances, fees, positions and the feeds
 * behind the websocket. An unmade decision about a futures payout pot took the
 * exchange down with it.
 *
 * That is failing closed on the wrong axis. The blast radius of a missing
 * decision should match the scope of the decision: nobody chose a futures
 * profit pot, so FUTURES is what must not run.
 * `optionalProfitSourceFromConfig` draws that line, and it is a narrow one:
 *
 *   · ABSENT → `null`. Futures opens are refused and no realised profit can be
 *     paid. The rest of svc-trade serves normally.
 *   · PRESENT but wrong (unparseable, or an account the recipe does not draw
 *     from) → STILL THROWS AT BOOT. Somebody made a decision and mistyped it,
 *     and a typo in the pot that funds payouts is not something to find out
 *     about at the first profitable close.
 *
 * The ADR's rule survives whole, because the rule was never "the process must
 * exit". It was that realised profit is paid from an account the owner named,
 * and an unconfigured deployment now pays no realised profit at all — which is
 * the strictest available reading of it, not a weaker one.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THE CONFIGURED ACCOUNT IS CHECKED AGAINST THE RECIPE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The bound is only a bound if it guards the account the money actually leaves.
 * Checking `A` and debiting `B` is worse than not checking at all, because it
 * reads like a control.
 *
 * `futuresRealizeProfit` is a ledger recipe and recipes are an owner carve-out
 * (`DIRECTION` §3), so this file does not change which account it credits.
 * Instead it ASKS the recipe — builds a probe request and reads the funding leg
 * off it — and refuses to boot when the configured account is not that one,
 * naming the recipe change that would be required. The owner can then name a
 * different account knowing exactly what it costs, rather than discovering the
 * mismatch as a silent overdraw.
