/**
 * LOAN RECIPES (§8.1 — "collateralLock recipe … liquidation via internal book,
 * interest accrual daily recipe").
 *
 * ⚠ SHARED-PACKAGE CHANGE — flagged deliberately, and it REPLACES code.
 *
 * `recipes/index.ts` previously carried three lending stubs — `collateralLock`,
 * `collateralRelease` and `liquidate`. Nothing in the monorepo called any of
 * them, and a loan could not have been built on them:
 *
 *   1. They locked into `userCollateral(user, asset)` with NO purpose, so two
 *      loans in one asset shared a collateral pot (now fixed at the account
 *      constructor, and enforced by `assertPurposedLocks`).
 *   2. There was NO WAY TO RELEASE PRINCIPAL. `collateralLock` locked the
 *      borrower's collateral and the sequence stopped there — no draw, no debt,
 *      no repayment. Half of a loan is not a loan.
 *   3. `liquidate` debited the ENTIRE seizure to `houseFees('bank')`. Not to the
 *      lender, not against the debt — the whole of a borrower's seized
 *      collateral was booked as platform profit, because there was no reserve
 *      for it to return to and no debt for it to extinguish.
 *   4. `bank.liquidate:<loanId>` keyed one liquidation per loan for all time,
 *      which forbids the partial ladder outright.
 *
 * The five recipes below are kept in their own file so this diff is reviewable —
 * and revertable — separately from the rest of the shared package, the same way
 * `bank.ts` was.
 *
 * ── THE ORDERING IS THE PRODUCT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A loan is a leveraged position taken with the reserve's money. §8.1's sequence
 * is load-bearing, not descriptive, and each step is a separate transaction on
 * purpose:
 *
 *   loanCollateralLock   borrower available → borrower collateral(loan:<id>)
 *   loanDraw             loan reserve       → borrower available
 *   loanRepay            borrower available → reserve (principal) + house (interest)
 *   loanCollateralRelease borrower collateral(loan:<id>) → borrower available
 *   loanLiquidate        collateral → buyer, buyer's cash → reserve + house + borrower
 *
 * Two things follow from splitting lock and draw rather than fusing them into
 * one atomic post, and both were deliberate:
 *
 *   · A crash between them strands NOTHING. The collateral is in the borrower's
 *     own purposed account and the reserve has not moved, so the loan is simply
 *     un-drawn: re-driving it completes, and abandoning it releases. The reverse
 *     order — draw then lock — has a crash window in which the borrower holds
 *     principal against no collateral, and that window cannot be closed by a
 *     retry because the borrower can spend in it.
 *   · One fused transaction would be atomic but would also make "collateralised
 *     but not yet drawn" unrepresentable, and that is a state an operator needs
 *     when a draw is refused for a reason that is not the borrower's fault.

/**
 * ONE RUNG of a liquidation: seize, sell, repay — as a single transaction.

 * ── WHY THIS IS ONE TRANSACTION AND NOT THREE ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious implementation is: release collateral to the borrower's available
 * balance, place a sell order, apply the proceeds. It is wrong, and it is wrong
 * in a way that only shows up under exactly the conditions a liquidation happens
 * in. Between the release and the sale the borrower holds spendable collateral on
 * a defaulting loan, and they are watching. One withdrawal in that window and
 * the platform is unsecured, holding an order that no longer has anything behind
 * it. The window cannot be closed with a lock, because the lock is the thing
 * being released.
 *
 * So the sale and the repayment are the same posting, and the collateral goes
 * from the borrower's purposed pot straight to the buyer. There is no instant at
 * which the borrower can touch it, and no instant at which the buyer holds
 * collateral they have not paid for.
 *
 * ── SUM-TO-ZERO ACROSS TWO ASSETS ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `assertBalanced` checks per asset, so both halves must close independently:
 * the collateral leg moves `collateralSold` from borrower to buyer, and the debt
 * leg splits exactly `proceeds` four ways. The four-way split is checked here
 * rather than left to the ledger's balance error, so a caller that mis-allocates
 * gets told which figure is wrong instead of "USDT off by 3".
