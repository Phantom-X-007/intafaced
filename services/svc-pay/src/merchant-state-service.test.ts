 * MERCHANT STATE HAS A WRITER AND A HISTORY.

 * has no history and no writer. `status='suspended'` is read and enforced by a
 * code path that nothing writes… a suspension cannot be explained, dated, or
 * undone, and an operator cannot answer 'why is this merchant suspended' from
 * the database."*
 *
 * THE TEST THAT MATTERS is the ADR's own sentence turned into an assertion:
 * after a suspension, is the answer to "why" in the database. Everything else
 * here defends that one.
 *
 * Postgres is real, and it has to be: the append-only guarantee is a TRIGGER and
 * the non-blank reason is a CHECK. An in-memory fake would have neither and
 * would pass while the deployed schema did not.
 *
 * H8a PG-hard: this file never `describe.skip` / `postgresAvailable`. CI uses
 * TEST_DATABASE_URL (per-run database via `createTestDatabase` so schema-qualified
 * `pay.*` SQL stays on `pay`). Local without that env starts Testcontainers
 * `postgres:16-alpine`. Docker/PG down is a failed suite, not a green skip.
 * The admin URL is `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, not `TEST_DATABASE_URL_PAY`: creating a
 * database needs CREATEDB, which the per-service roles deliberately lack.
