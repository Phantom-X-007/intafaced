# Incident runbook — money path (ledger / trade red)

**Tracker:** D26-P3-10 · LIVE-LANES `denon-d26-p3-10-incident`  
**Class:** N (ops procedure). Does **not** close Class X go-live.  
**Law:** Doctrine §4.2 (unverifiable book → freeze posting) · §14.6 (operator kill, never trap funds) · [`../INTERNET-LEVERAGE-LAW.md`](../INTERNET-LEVERAGE-LAW.md) Phase A IN (name existing doors; do not rebuild them).  
**How to pull a switch (curl / console):** [`../OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md`](../OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md) — this file is **who does what when**, not a second copy of those commands.  
**Restore is not claimed here.** Backup / restore drill is **D26-P3-09** (open residual). See §4.

This page exists so agents and humans can act when **ledger posting** or **trade/match** is red **without inventing a new money control**. If a door is not named below, it is not in this playbook.

## 0 · Decision tree (one screen)

| What you see | First contain (existing door only) | Who |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | --- |
| Book unverifiable (recon fail, chain break, freeze already on) | **Ledger posting freeze** — `POST /admin/ledger/freeze` on svc-edge (`admin:treasury` + MFA). Do **not** use a module kill as a substitute. | Denon (or treasury-token holder). Agents page; they do not invent freeze policy. |
| New trade risk is the problem; book still posts | **Edge module kill `trade`** — `POST /admin/kill-switches` (`admin:write` + MFA). Cancels and reads must still pass. | Denon / operator with `admin:write`. |
| Spot plane only | Process flag `TRADE_SPOT_ENABLED=false` (svc-trade) — already in `services/svc-trade/README.md`. Takes the instance out of LB via `/ready` 503. Does **not** halt futures. | Denon. Agents do not invent a combined boolean. |
| Futures plane only | `TRADE_FUTURES_ENABLED=false` — refuses new futures orders; not an outage of spot. | Denon. |
| Engine must stop taking new rest | `MATCHING_ENGINE_ENABLED=false` / `matching.engine` — submissions refuse **before journal**; cancels + depth still work. Edge kill of `matching` is **audit-only**. | Denon. |
| Incident is on Protocol / INTACHAIN / dex self-custody | **Stop.** Shehzad owns implement. Agents babysit only. | Shehzad (`@shehzad002`). |
| Need a host backup, secret rotate, prod RPC, sanctions list, licence | **Class X.** This runbook does not authorize it. | Nitro human (+ counsel). |
| Want to restore Postgres / matching journal | **D26-P3-09 not done.** Do not restore. Contain with freeze/kill above. | See §4. |

**Never:** invent freeze magnitudes, a new kill flag, a second book, or a “halt everything including cancels” switch. A control that traps open risk is not a safety control ([`../OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md`](../OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md)).

## 1 · Detect — probes, metrics, logs (files that already exist)

Unauthenticated `/ready` is for load balancers. It is **not** the operator halt oracle on the edge.

| Signal | File / route | What red looks like |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Ledger posting down | `services/svc-ledger/src/index.ts` `GET /ready` (compose `svc-ledger:4001`) | **503** `{ ready: false, reason }` when `postingEnabled` is false. Frozen ledger **leaves LB rotation** instead of refusing posts one-by-one (`services/svc-ledger/README.md`). |
| Ledger liveness vs freeze | same file `GET /health` | Still 200 with status payload including freeze fields — liveness ≠ posting. |
| Durable freeze row | `services/svc-ledger/src/ledger/freeze.ts` · `services/svc-ledger/src/service.ts` | Freeze is a **database fact** (`posting_freeze`), not process memory. |
| Recon self-freeze | `services/svc-ledger/src/service.ts` `reconcile()` · cron in `index.ts` | On mismatch: freeze attributed to `reconciliation`, log **FATAL** `LEDGER RECONCILIATION FAILED`, events below. |
| Ledger events | `services/svc-ledger/README.md` | `intafaced.ledger.reconciliation.failed` · `intafaced.ledger.freeze.updated` (both freeze and thaw). |
| Trade placement unfit | `services/svc-trade/src/index.ts` `GET /ready` (`svc-trade:4004`) | **503** if `TRADE_SPOT_ENABLED` off (`reason: trade.spot flag is off`) **or** engine sequence **regressions** vs `trade.fills` (`services/svc-trade/src/spot/sequence-guard.ts`). |
| Trade liveness extras | same `GET /health` | MM seed / futures jobs / venue latency **health presentation** — not a freeze switch. |
| Matching unfit | `services/svc-matching/src/index.ts` `GET /ready` (`svc-matching:4005`) | **503** `{ reason: 'matching.engine flag is off' }`. |
| Matching journal vs book | `services/svc-matching/README.md` · boot warn in `index.ts` | Resting orders replayed with **no** local proof of ledger holds. Compare via `POST /reconcile` (service credentials). Caller job: `TRADE_RECONCILE_JOBS_ENABLED` default **OFF** — [`../ENGINE-LEDGER-RECONCILE-HANDOFF.md`](../ENGINE-LEDGER-RECONCILE-HANDOFF.md). Alarm only until an operator resolves; do not auto-delete funded orders. |
| Edge process up | `services/svc-edge/src/index.ts` `GET /ready` (`svc-edge:4000`) | Route prefixes, wiring, screening/CORS **counts**, rate-limit posture, body budget. **`disabledModules` is absent** — unauthenticated `/ready` is not a kill-switch oracle (`services/svc-edge/README.md`). |
| Operator halt list | `GET /admin/status` · `GET /admin/kill-switches` | `admin:write` + MFA. Implemented in `services/svc-edge/src/control-plane.ts` + `admin-api.ts`. |
| User-facing SLO scrape | `GET /metrics` on svc-edge · `services/svc-edge/src/metrics.ts` | Prometheus job `svc-edge` in `tooling/infra/prometheus.yaml` (`svc-edge:4000/metrics`, 10s). Grafana panel: `tooling/infra/grafana/dashboards/edge-slo.json`. **svc-trade does not expose `/metrics` on tip** — do not invent a per-service scrape. |
| Structural proof the kill exists | `tooling/ci/killswitch-reachability.mjs` | Part of `pnpm verify` / gates. Behavioural: `services/svc-edge/src/control-plane.e2e.test.ts`. |
| WS still live under an edge kill | `services/svc-edge/README.md` · `docs/ops/P-WS-INTEGRITY-REPORT-2026-08-03.md` | `svc-ws:4014` is **outside the door**. Edge kill cannot halt market-data sockets. Honest residual — do not treat a green halt on `/admin/status` as “tape is dead.” |

Compose ports: `docker-compose.apps.yml` (`intafaced-svc-ledger` 4001, `svc-edge` 4000, `svc-trade` 4004, `svc-matching` 4005).

## 2 · Contain — existing freeze / kill doors only

**Do not add a new flag, env, or magnitude in an incident.** Use these, in this order of blast radius.

### 2.1 Ledger posting freeze (all value movement)

| Piece | Where |
| ----- | ----- |
| Edge proxy | `GET/POST /admin/ledger/freeze` · `POST /admin/ledger/unfreeze` — `services/svc-edge/src/control-plane.ts` (`admin:treasury` + MFA). Needs `LEDGER_URL` on the edge; unset → **503** `edge.ledger_unreachable`, never a fake success. |
| Ledger operator HTTP | `GET/POST /operator/freeze` · `POST /operator/unfreeze` · `POST /operator/reconcile` — `services/svc-ledger/src/operator-http.ts`. |
| Console hop | `apps/admin` `/api/ledger-freeze` — documented in [`../OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md`](../OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md). Front-end path is HUMAN (`nitro-frontend-all`); agents do not craft Vue. |
| Boot-only freeze | `LEDGER_POSTING_ENABLED=false` — `LedgerService.applyStartupPolicy` **can freeze and can never thaw** via that flag. **Not** the interactive incident lever. Prefer `/admin/ledger/freeze`. |

Use freeze after an **unverifiable book** (§4.2), not as a substitute for killing a single module.

### 2.2 Edge module kill (new commitments; users can still get out)

| Piece | Where |
| ----- | ----- |
| Guard | `services/svc-edge/src/kill-switch.ts` + `registerKillSwitchGuard` in `control-plane.ts` |
| Flip | `POST /admin/kill-switches` `{ module, disabled, reason }` (`reason` ≥ 12 chars) |
| Durability | optional `EDGE_KILL_STATE_PATH` (default `.data/edge-kill-state.json`) — **per host**. Multi-replica share is still a §13 socket. |
| Money-route completeness pin | `services/svc-edge/src/money-routes.kill-switch.test.ts` |

**Enforced** only for modules in `UPSTREAMS` (`services/svc-edge/src/routes.ts`): `trade`, `pay`, `identity`, …  
Killing `ws`, `matching`, `ledger`, `edge` on this board is **audit-only**. Ledger halt is §2.1. Matching halt is §2.3.

When `trade` is killed: new places → **503** `edge.module_killed` (or `edge.kill_switch_undecidable` fail-closed). Still pass: tRPC `cancel`, `DELETE /api/v1/orders` / `:id`, `DELETE /api/v1/positions/:id` (`ALWAYS_ALLOWED_REST` in `kill-switch.ts`).

### 2.3 In-service flags already wired (not new policy)

| Flag | Effect already documented |
| ---- | ------------------------- |
| `TRADE_SPOT_ENABLED` / `trade.spot` | New spot refused `trade.spot_disabled`; `/ready` 503. Cancels/reads stay. `services/svc-trade/README.md` Kill-switch. |
| `TRADE_FUTURES_ENABLED` / `trade.futures` | New futures refused; spot unaffected. |
| `TRADE_CONVERT` / convert kill | Convert execute refuses `trade.convert_disabled`. |
| `TRADE_ALGO` / algo kill | TWAP create refuses `trade.algo_disabled`. |
| `TRADE_MM_SEED_ENABLED` | Seed/mm place refuse (SD-4). Default OFF. |
| `MATCHING_ENGINE_ENABLED` / `matching.engine` | `engine_disabled` before journal; `/ready` 503. `services/svc-matching/README.md`. |
| Per-market | `setMarketStatus` on svc-trade — finer grain; same “no new risk, no confiscation.” |

**Not a kill switch:** rolling back a deploy (staging workflow). Named in [`../THREAT-MODEL-STAGING-DEPLOY.md`](../THREAT-MODEL-STAGING-DEPLOY.md) §8 row 14.

**Not this playbook:** pay rails / bank earn / partner vendor kills ([`../OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md`](../OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md) “What this does not cover”). Vendored Java dual-book needs its own halt if still mounted.

## 3 · Roles (who may act)

Binding split: [`../THREE-WAY-DISTRIBUTION-2026-08-04.md`](../THREE-WAY-DISTRIBUTION-2026-08-04.md) · [`../NITRO-OWNERSHIP-AND-DENON-DIRECTION-2026-07-31.md`](../NITRO-OWNERSHIP-AND-DENON-DIRECTION-2026-07-31.md).

| Role | During a money-path incident | Must not |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| **Denon** (`@Phantom-X-007`) | Incident **technical lead**. Chooses freeze vs module kill vs plane flag. Runs `/operator/reconcile`. Authorizes **unfreeze** only after the book verifies. Product-law calls if the incident exposes a missing spec. | Invent new freeze magnitudes; close Class X; implement Shehzad chain. |
| **Nitro human** (`@ZenYoda3`) Class **X** | Secrets, prod/staging **host** acts, licence, sanctions **content**, wallet_rpc go-live, **take or restore a database backup** (threat-model row 15 — still owner). Rotate leaked credentials. | Be asked to run git/PR. Agents run the loop. |
| **Shehzad** (`@shehzad002`) | If the red is **Protocol Plane / INTACHAIN / bridge / dex self-custody / venue contracts** — he implements. Agents file symptoms and stop. | Agents writing chain code “to help.” |
| **Agents** (Nitro or Denon session) | **Babysit:** detect from §1, page the right human, follow this page, operate **existing** doors if credentials are already in the environment, keep cancels working, write an honest incident note (what probe, which door pulled, PR/chat link). Open Class N docs/fix PRs that do not invent money law. | Invent kill/freeze policy; restore data; merge Class X as done; dual-edit Shehzad chain mountains; craft Vue (`nitro-frontend-all`); expose `apps/admin` without ACL/SSO (P0 residual on the kill runbook). |

**Credential reminder (already law, not new):** freeze needs `admin:treasury`; module kill needs `admin:write` + MFA. Do not share those tokens in chat or commit them.

---

## 4 · Restore is **not** claimed (D26-P3-09 residual)

| Fact | Pointer |
| ---- | ------- |
| Board mountain **D26-P3-09** “Money data backup / restore drill” — done bar: *one exercised restore path documented* | [`../DENON-HARD-PARALLEL-BOARD-2026-08-09.md`](../DENON-HARD-PARALLEL-BOARD-2026-08-09.md) §7 |
| No exercised restore path on tip as of this runbook | Search: no `docs/ops` backup-drill doc |
| Staging threat model: **take or restore a database backup** is owner, **no retention policy to implement** | [`../THREAT-MODEL-STAGING-DEPLOY.md`](../THREAT-MODEL-STAGING-DEPLOY.md) §8 row 15 · named gap **D4** |
| Asymmetric restore is a known money failure | Matching journal vs Postgres fills — [`../adr/2026-08-07-fill-sequence-key-stays.md`](../adr/2026-08-07-fill-sequence-key-stays.md). Restoring one store and not the other is how sequence regression `/ready` 503 exists. |

**Until P3-09 lands:** contain with §2; do **not** `pg_restore` / replay a journal / copy volumes as an incident step. Unfreeze only when posting is legal again on the **current** book — that is Denon’s call, not a restore.

---

## 5 · After contain (still not restore)

1. Keep **cancels** and documented release REST working. Confirm with a cancel, not with a new place.
2. Recon: `POST /admin/ledger/…` reconcile path / `POST /operator/reconcile` — freeze-on-failure is already coded; do not skip it to “look green.”
3. Engine↔ledger: if `TRADE_RECONCILE_JOBS_ENABLED` logs `REFUSE`, operator resolves; auto-delete is **unfunded pending only**.
4. Un-kill / unfreeze with a reason ≥ 12 characters, same doors as contain.
5. If the hole was missing **procedure**, patch **this file** (or the kill runbook). If the hole was missing **code**, that is a different tracker id — do not smuggle a new money control into an incident PR.

---

## 6 · Honest residuals (named, not invented)

1. **D26-P3-09** backup/restore drill — open.  
2. **D26-P3-08** alerts + one real (non-local) dashboard — local compose scrape + `edge-slo.json` exist; remote alert routes are a separate mountain.  
3. Multi-replica kill-switch store · operator SSO · flag store · console reconcile stub — [`../OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md`](../OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md) §13.  
4. Edge cannot halt `svc-ws`.  
5. `edge.gateway` flag is `NOT_ENFORCED` — live kill is `/admin/kill-switches`, not that flag (`services/svc-edge/README.md`).  
6. Admin BFF shared token without network ACL — P0 residual; ship gate for real money.

---

## Leverage

Phase A **IN** — `svc-edge` kill/freeze proxy, `svc-ledger` durable freeze, `svc-trade` / `svc-matching` `/ready` + existing env flags, Prometheus scrape already wired. Horizon: D26-P3-10 is ops procedure (this file). No second admin product, no second book, no greenfield kill-switch.
