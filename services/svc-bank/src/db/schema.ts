 * svc-bank — MULTI-CURRENCY ACCOUNTS OVER THE LEDGER (§8.1).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS NOT IN THIS FILE, AND WILL NEVER BE: A BALANCE.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §8.1: "Multi-currency account UX over existing ledger accounts (no new
 * balance system — views + rails)." Doctrine §0.6: "No module holds its own
 * balance."
 *
 * Every table here stores one of exactly three things:
 *
 *   1. A NAME AND A POLICY — what the user calls a pot of money, and the rules
 *      they attached to it. `spaces` is a label over a ledger account; it holds
 *      no value and cannot hold value.
 *   2. AN INSTRUCTION — "move 200 USDT on the 1st of every month". Amounts on
 *      instructions are immutable after insert: they are what the user asked
 *      for, not what anything currently holds.
 *   3. A RECORD OF SOMETHING THAT ALREADY HAPPENED — one row per (schedule,
 *      occurrence) or per (pool, day), written once, never updated in place with
 *      a new figure. These exist to make a job idempotent and auditable, not to
 *      answer "how much".
 *
 * "How much" is always `ledger.balance(...)`. There is exactly one answer, and
 * it is not in this schema. `bank-service.test.ts` introspects
 * `information_schema.columns` and fails the build on any column that looks
 * like a running total, so this comment is enforced rather than aspirational.
 *
 * The one column that is money-shaped and mutable — there is none — would need
 * the narrow exception svc-token's README describes (a cache with a documented
 * reconciliation job). svc-bank does not take it. A cache of a number the
 * ledger already returns in one indexed read buys nothing and costs a second
 * source of truth.
 */

 * `owner_type` includes `subaccount`); svc-bank invents nothing.
 *

 * re-driving either finds the original transaction or makes it).
 *
 * `skipped` is the opposite of `pending`: nothing was ever attempted, because
 * the standing order was paused when this occurrence came due. It is a ROW
 * rather than an absence because `MAX(occurrence)` over this table is what
 * `planDue` reads as `lastFired` — an occurrence with no row is one the next
 * pass will fire, so without this value resuming a three-month pause would post
 * three months of transfers at once.
 *
 * `rejected` is deliberately not reused for it. Rejected means the ledger
 * refused a real attempt, which is the answer to "why is my space empty".
 * Skipped means nobody asked, which is the answer to "why did nothing happen
 * while I was away". Collapsing them leaves both unanswerable.

// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// LOANS (§8.1) — collateral lock, LTV marking, margin call, liquidation, accrual
// ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// THERE IS NO `outstanding` COLUMN. A loan's debt is the number that decides
// whether someone's collateral is sold, and the obvious schema gives `loans` an
// `outstanding_principal` that a nightly job adds to. The guard in
// `bank-service.test.ts` fails the build on that column by name, and it is right
// to: a mutable money column written by a job is a running total, and a half-run
// accrual or a repayment racing it leaves a figure nothing can contradict — while
// every LTV afterwards is computed from it.
//
// So the debt is EVENT-SOURCED from the write-once tables below, and
// `loan-service.ts` derives it in bigint on every read:
//
//   outstanding = loans.principal
//               + Σ loanInterestAccruals.interestAmount
//               − Σ loanRepayments.(principalAmount + interestAmount)
//               − Σ loanLiquidations.(principalRepaid + interestRepaid)
//
// Not a VIEW either: a view's columns appear in `information_schema.columns`, so
// exposing this sum as one would either trip the guard or have to be named to
// dodge it — and dodging a guard that is telling the truth is worse than the
// column would have been. See 0002_bank_loans.sql for the long form.
//
// Basis-point columns here are `integer`, not `bps()`/numeric(8,0) as the earn
// tables use. Deliberate: a basis point IS an integer, and numeric(8,0)
// round-trips as a string that every risk call site would then have to `Number()`
// — exactly the kind of casual parse this module cannot afford. Neither shape is
// money-typed, so the schema guard is indifferent between them.

// one account per authorisation, so "what is held" is a sum the ledger already
// knows and this schema deliberately does not mirror.

// DECISION taken on each authorisation, and a write-once record of each
// completed movement. Nothing accumulates.
