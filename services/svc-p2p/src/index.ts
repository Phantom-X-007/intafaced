/**
 * svc-p2p — peer-to-peer trading with escrow (§6.2).
 *
 * Two things start here that are not optional, and both are the same promise
 * from different ends:
 *
 *   · the TIMEOUT sweep, which acts on any trade whose deadline has passed
 *     (re-drive / refund / open dispute / escalate-and-rearm — never auto-rule
 *     a disputed release; that holds until a human moderator decides);
 *   · the SETTLEMENT sweep, which posts any resolution that was decided but
 *     not yet acted on (decide-then-post; late is OK, unexecuted is not).
 *
 * Together they keep funds from stranding without a path: every non-disputed
 * live clock eventually disposes or re-drives; every committed decision is
 * re-posted until stamped. Disputed escrow is held on purpose until a natural
 * person rules. If this process does not run the sweeps, the other states can
 * strand — so they are started before the HTTP listener, not after.
