# Build coverage audit — the law, the later decisions, and the tracker

**Question asked:** _"Are we building every feature from the definitive build, plus the changes we layered on top of it?"_

**Type:** audit. **No code was changed.** Read-only against `main` @ `99a7673` (#429), `tooling/tracker/features.mjs` (127 rows), `INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md` v2.2 (862 lines), 4 ADRs, 5 `SPEC-*` docs.
**Decision owner:** repo owner. **Nothing here is a decision.** Where a §-number and an ADR disagree, this document reports the disagreement and does not resolve it.

---

## The answer, up front

**No — and the mechanism that was supposed to tell you that was never built.**

§25 line 740 of the law says, verbatim:

> _CI carries `coverage-check`: this matrix is machine-readable (`tooling/coverage.yaml`); any Vol. I feature without a green DoD at its phase gate blocks the drop phase that promised it. **Never half done — enforced.**_

`tooling/coverage.yaml` **does not exist.** No `coverage-check` job exists in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The law specified a machine to answer exactly the question you just asked, and that machine is one of the things that was never built — which is why this audit had to be done by hand, and why the gap it found is the size it is.

# A · THE LAW → THE TRACKER

## A1 · Specified in the law, **no tracker row at all** — 40

These are the ones that get silently forgotten. A prior audit found five (vendored, §B3); the full sweep finds forty.

### A1.d — soft gaps: named in the law, folded into a coarser row, never named again

Not counted above. They are not forgotten, but nobody can tell from the board whether they are built:

## A2 · Specified, tracked — and where the score and the code disagree

The tracker is broadly honest; its notes are unusually good. Four rows are not.

| `chain.mainnet`     | `:576-581`     | ⛔ blocked **on `protocol.amm`**                                                       | No `services/svc-chain`, zero Go files, no genesis/app.toml/config.toml, no CometBFT/Cosmos dependency anywhere. `packages/config/src/flags.ts:120` is a null-default flag; `services/svc-dex/src/quote/indexer-venue.ts:82` is a venue-id **string** | **Wrong blocker.** Closing `protocol.amm` would not unblock it by one day. See §B4 |
| `venue.aggregation` | `:312`         | Title: "External venue adapters **via CCXT**"                                          | §27 `:755` forbids a third-party connectivity library in the money path; the row's own note says "NOT 'via CCXT' … there is no `ccxt` in the workspace by design"                                                                                     | **Title contradicts the law it implements.** Note is right, title is not           |
| `trade.copy`        | `:277-284`     | Title: "…audited leaders, **profit share**"; `plane: 'B'`; `dependsOn: ['trade.spot']` | `SPEC-SOVEREIGN-ROUTING-AND-COPY-2026-08-01.md:95` forbids any P&L-linked fee; `:24` routes copy execution to **Protocol**; `:158` makes session-key scope the first thing that ships                                                                 | **Three errors in one row.** See §B2                                               |

Rows whose notes are conspicuously honest and should be read as the standard: `infra.i18n` (`:123`), `ops.admin` (`:786`), `blueprint.ownership` (`:566`), `blueprint.card` (`:551`), `socket.clob-contracts` (`:936`), `pay.rails` (`:387`), `trade.forex` (`:289`).

# B · THE LATER DECISIONS → THE TRACKER AND THE LAW

## B1 · The sovereign routing rule — built in code, **absent from the tracker, and inverted by its default**

**Is it tracked?** No.

- There is **no row** for permissionless / no-KYC access. §25 `:642` lists "No-KYC lane | P | entire plane, by architecture | 3P" as a capability with an owner and a phase. No tracker row exists for it.
- The only mention of §22 anywhere in 960 lines of tracker is one clause inside `identity.kyc-review`'s note (`features.mjs:172`): _"§22 permissionless surfaces read no tier"_. That is the entire board presence of the platform's differentiating claim.
- It is **implicit in the `plane` field only** — `'F' | 'P' | 'B'` per row.

**The code is well ahead of the board.** Verified:

| Thing                                      | Where                                                                                     | State                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `checkAccess` permissionless short-circuit | `packages/config/src/jurisdiction.ts:363`                                                 | Real: `q.plane === 'protocol' && !mod.custodial`                                                                                          |
| Region screening runs **before** it        | `packages/config/src/jurisdiction.ts:365-374`                                             | Correct, and the ordering is documented as load-bearing at `:358-362`. Matches `SPEC-SOVEREIGN…:140`                                      |
| Custodial registry                         | `packages/config/src/modules.ts:64-109`                                                   | `dex`, `chain`, `indexer`, `protocol` = `custodial:false`; `bridge` deliberately `true`                                                   |
| Enforcement                                | `packages/contracts/src/trpc.ts:114-175`                                                  | One middleware, not re-implemented per service. 20 procedures in `svc-protocol`, 7 in `svc-indexer`, 2 in `svc-dex`                       |
| User-visible lane                          | `apps/web/src/components/terminal/plane-switch.tsx:31-50`; `apps/web/src/lib/plane.ts:59` | "A wallet. No sign-in, no verification, no account." Protocol panels use a **token-free** client (`apps/web/src/lib/providers.tsx:53-62`) |

**The one thing that is actively wrong.** `tooling/tracker/features.mjs:60`:

```js
plane: opts.plane ?? 'F',
```

**The tracker's default plane is Fiat.** `SPEC-SOVEREIGN-ROUTING-AND-COPY-2026-08-01.md:17` says the opposite: _"A feature goes on the Fiat Plane only if it must hold user value or must know who the user is."_ Every new row added without an explicit `plane:` silently lands custodial. The routing rule is not merely untracked — the registry's default contradicts it, and does so invisibly.

**Residual honesty risk, not a code bug:** the permissionless lane's screening is only as real as `INTAFACED_SANCTIONS_REGIONS`, which ships **empty** (`packages/config/src/screening.ts:25-32`), and no `JURISDICTION_MATRIX` entry carries `blocked:true` (`packages/config/src/jurisdiction.ts:144-167`, self-labelled "Illustrative structure only — populate per counsel"). Prod/staging refuse to boot without it (`:516-534`), which is right. The list itself is `DIRECTION-2026-07-31.md` §8.7 — counsel, not engineering.

## B2 · Copy trading — **the tracker still says the old thing**

`tooling/tracker/features.mjs:277-284`:

```js
f('trade.copy', 'Copy trading, audited leaders, profit share', {
  module: 'trade', phase: '2', plane: 'B', owner: 'shehzad002',
  dependsOn: ['trade.spot'],
  note: 'HUMAN M4 @shehzad002. Agents must not invent copy product.',
}),
```

| What the row says           | What the accepted spec says                                                                                                                         | Cite                  |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| "**profit share**"          | _"**Not permitted in v1:** any fee computed from follower P&L, in any form — percentage of gains, high-water mark, hurdle rate, or 'success fee'."_ | `SPEC-SOVEREIGN…:95`  |
| `plane: 'B'`                | copy execution → **Protocol**, "user's own account signs; we never hold"                                                                            | `SPEC-SOVEREIGN…:24`  |
| `dependsOn: ['trade.spot']` | _"Session-key scope + on-chain caps in `SmartAccount` — **the whole safety model is here; nothing else ships first**"_                              | `SPEC-SOVEREIGN…:158` |
| note: no spec reference     | `DIRECTION-2026-07-31.md:80` marks copy **SUPERSEDED 2026-08-01** and names the spec                                                                |                       |

The law is stale in the same two places: §5.2 `:256` ("profit-share settled monthly by ledger recipe") and §25 `:629` ("Copy trading (audited leaders, profit share) | **B**").

**Consequence, concretely:** the row is owned by a human (M4), phased at 2, and depends on a `done` row — so it renders in `docs/TRACKER.md` under **"🟢 Claim these now"** as _"Copy trading, audited leaders, profit share"_. Anyone reading only the board builds a performance-fee product against a spot exchange. That is the exact shape three separate documents forbid. A wrong row is worse than a missing one.

`agents.copy-intel` (`:656`) is consistent with §5.2 but pre-dates §4 of the spec ("no leaderboard ranked by returns") — "audited stats" remains permitted; ranking does not. Worth a note, not a rescore.

## B3 · The vendored product — adopted by ADR, **invisible on the board**

`docs/adr/2026-08-02-adopt-vendored-product-keep-our-ledger.md` is **Accepted**. It says (`:46`):

> _"**Stop rebuilding these.** Five have no tracker row, and that absence is the mechanism by which they keep getting rebuilt — so **the rows get created as part of adoption.**"_

**The rows were not created.** `grep -i vendor tooling/tracker/features.mjs` → zero rows. One day after the ADR, the adoption obligation it wrote for itself is unmet.

| ADR obligation                                                                                                                   | Tracker state                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ADOPT AS-IS: shell + screens, OTC + admin workflows, CMS, support, statistics + finance reporting, admin RBAC                    | **0 rows**                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| The five with no row (`VENDORED-OVERLAP-AUDIT.md:332`): CMS, red envelope, activity/sign-in, support chat content, mining orders | **still 0 rows**                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ADOPT AND ADAPT: every controller reaching `MemberWalletService` — keep the workflow, redirect the balance write                 | **0 rows.** `ORDER-ROUTE-VENDOR-MONEY-INVENTORY.md:64-69` counts 7 controllers, 14 controller call-sites, 23 non-controller call-sites, 5 DAO defs — a real work queue with no board presence |
| `01_wallet_rpc` — adopted, security review a **precondition**                                                                    | **0 rows.** 14 controllers handling BTC/ETH/USDT/EOS private keys, on a classpath with 31 unverifiable `.jar` binaries                                                                        |

**And the tracker scores the wrong front end.** `apps/web` is scored twice — `web.shell` **`done`** (`:329`), `web.terminal` **`wip`/Nitro** (`:320`). The vendored shell is the one deployed at `:8090` and the one taking the work: `#412 #414 #417 #418 #419 #421 #426` are all `feat(vendor)`/`fix(vendor)`. `web.terminal`'s own note admits it (`features.mjs:327`): _"sub-accounts selector #358, a11y #367 **on vendor shell**"_. A row named `apps/web` is being progressed by commits to `vendor/`.

**Two enforcement gaps, one closed and one not:**

- ✅ The four dual-book mutators **are** now scanned in Java — `tooling/ci/vendor-java-money-scan.mjs:83` walks `.java`, roots at `vendor/`, fails closed if `vendor/` is missing, and is in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:44`). The ADR's and `DIRECTION` §4's complaint on this specific point is satisfied.
- ❌ **`custody-scan` still walks `.ts`/`.tsx` (`tooling/ci/custody-scan.mjs:80`) and `.sol` (`:101`) only.** Doctrine 10 — "the custody boundary is drawn in code" — is structurally blind to 949 Java files. This is finding F1 of `VENDORED-OVERLAP-AUDIT.md:326`, restated by the ADR as "closes alongside, not after", and it is **still open**.
- ❌ **`workspace-sync` check 7 covers nothing in `vendor/`.** `tooling/ci/workspace-sync.mjs:445-447` discovers vendored front-ends via `workspacesUnder('vendor')`, which only returns directories carrying their own `package.json` — and `vendor/upstream-exchange/package.json` does not exist, so the array is empty. Verified by running the scan: `workspace-sync clean — 17 service(s)`. `04_Web_Admin` has a `build` script, appears in neither compose file, and carries no `# no-deploy:` reason — **the gate written for exactly this failure passes.** The comment at `:442-444` claims vendored front-ends are "DISCOVERED, not named"; they are not discovered.

## B4 · INTACHAIN — what `chain.mainnet` is actually blocked on

**The row, in full** (`tooling/tracker/features.mjs:576-581`):

```js
f('chain.mainnet', 'INTACHAIN — CometBFT + native CLOB module', {
  module: 'chain', phase: '4P', plane: 'P',
  dependsOn: ['matching.engine', 'protocol.amm'],
}),
```

No `status`. No `note`. No `owner`. `docs/TRACKER.md:202` therefore renders **⛔ blocked · `protocol.amm`**.

**That is not what it is blocked on.** Verified:

- `services/svc-chain` — **does not exist.** Named only as an aspiration at `INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md:532`.
- `services/svc-bridge` — **does not exist.** `tooling/ci/custody-scan.mjs:30` excludes it from the Protocol-Plane list; it excludes a service that was never written.
- Repo-wide `INTACHAIN|CometBFT|cosmos-sdk|tendermint` returns **prose, one null-default flag, and one string**: `packages/config/src/flags.ts:120` (`def('chain.mainnet', 'chain', null, …)`) and `services/svc-dex/src/quote/indexer-venue.ts:82` (`id = 'intachain-clob'`, which `services/svc-dex/README.md:100` says **refuses** with `not_ready`).
- Zero `.go` files. No `genesis.json`, no `app.toml`, no `config.toml`. The only chain code in the repo is **EVM**, not Cosmos.

**The real blockers, in order, and none of them is the AMM:**

1. **The §17.2 sequencing decision was never taken.** The law offers P0 (contracts on an established EVM L2, "ship value in weeks") → P1 (own CometBFT chain). Nothing on record chooses between them, and the repo has drifted into P0's _shape_ (EVM, viem, anvil) without ever adopting P0's _plan_. **Decision-blocked.**
2. **No production chain, no signing-key custody, no deployment record.** `docs/decisions/local-dev-chain.md:75-90` states this explicitly and titles itself _"A local dev chain is not a chain decision"_. `DIRECTION-2026-07-31.md` §8.3 reserves prod RPC + signing-key custody to the owner. **Decision-blocked.**
3. No validator plan, no CometBFT version, no owner named anywhere. **Unverified** that anyone has scoped it.
4. The **only** written blocker statement in the entire docs tree is one line: `docs/audit/2026-07-30-overnight-wave/WAVE-AUDIT-RESULT.md:39` — _"chain.mainnet — provider decision; smart-accounts 27 unlocks need real RPC."_

**Is the blocker recorded honestly?** **No.** The tracker says a dependency; the truth is a decision. Five rows sit behind it — `chain.evm`, `chain.validators`, `chain.governance`, `chain.rust-core`, `bridge.canonical` — and `bridge.canonical` is the only thing that would make §17.3's "one supply, two planes" true. An empty `note:` field is why nobody knows this, and it costs thirty seconds to fix.

## B5 · Where the law and the later decisions contradict each other — 10

**Do not edit the law from this document.** Each of these needs the owner's pen or an ADR.

## C4 · The one structural fix that would prevent the next version of this audit

`tooling/coverage.yaml` + a CI `coverage-check`, per §25 `:740`. It is the only item in this document that would have caught **all forty** A1 gaps automatically, and it is specified in the law as already being enforced.

## Method and limits

- Cites are `path:line` against `main` @ `99a7673`. Tracker row ids are `features.mjs` ids.
- "No tracker row" means: no `f(...)` entry whose id, title or note names the capability, verified by keyword grep across all 127 rows.
- `pnpm claim:check` reports "nothing to compare (no changes on this branch)" — this is a docs-only branch touching no owned lane, so no ownership conflict exists for this work. Ownership per row is read from `owner:` in `features.mjs`: `shehzad002` holds M1–M7 (`pay.*`, `trade.futures/otc/copy/algo`, `protocol.*`, `bank.*`, `identity.apikeys`); `Nitro` holds `web.terminal`, `ws.gateway`, `trade.mm-bot`. **No gap in §C1 sits in an agent's lane** — all seven are the owner's.
- Marked **unverified**: whether anyone has scoped INTACHAIN validators or a CometBFT version; whether `svc-bridge` and `svc-chain` would be jurisdiction-gated (neither exists); the exact vendored admin controller count (docs say 58, `find` says 57, `.vue` count is 92).
- This document reports contradictions. It does not resolve them, and it did not edit `INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md`.
