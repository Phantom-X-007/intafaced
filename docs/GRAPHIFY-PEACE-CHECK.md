## What “full peace” is, and is not

**Is:** the install is official; the map is real; tight queries find the next mountains; a builder _with a shell_ did query-first; the check now **smokes query+explain+diagnose** or goes RED.

**Is not:** a guarantee the next chat will obey. That is still a yes/no after the cook. Path/god-nodes can still send you to the wrong file if you ignore the `AGENTS.md` traps.

---

## After you code — two lines only

1. Agent runs `pnpm graphify:peace` → paste **RESULT**.
2. **Queried first this cook?** yes / no / not a code cook.

Green + yes = used as intended.  
Green + no = tool works, we wasted it.  
Red = extract/update, then re-check.

## Commands (agents)
