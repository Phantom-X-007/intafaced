# Peace-of-mind audit — automatic collab workflow

**Date:** 2026-07-27  
**Question:** Will every future chat, without Nitro enforcing it, work the right way with Denon?  
**Verdict (updated mid-ship):** Rules + START-HERE + session prompt live on branch `chore/agent-operator-flow` → open as PR; **still not automatic until that PR is merged to `main`.** After merge + pull, every chat that loads this repo gets operator/Denon modes.

`[VERIFIED 2026-07-27]` against local disk + `origin` + GitHub API.

## What you wanted (including unspoken)

| Need | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Peace of mind | One honest yes/no with proof, not hope |
| Automatic for *you* | Agents run git/worktree/PR; you get links + plain language |
| Automatic for *Denon* | His agents self-audit + worktrees without him re-reading process |
| Fast | No mutual-Approve theater |
| Not embarrassed | Don’t claim “we set it all up” if GitHub still has old AGENTS |
| Complete plan | Know every layer: docs → git → GitHub → agent load → human habit |

---

## Audit plan (what matters — complete set)

| Layer | What to check | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | Rules written (operator mode, asymmetric review) | Content exists |
| L2 | Committed on a branch | Survives a closed chat |
| L3 | On GitHub `main` | Denon + his agents + your other machines see it |
| L4 | Entry chain (`CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`) points at full rules | Cold agent loads them |
| L5 | Rules match the agreed model (no forced mutual Approve) | Docs don’t fight the plan |
| L6 | Mechanical guards (hook, CI, Free limits) | What is enforced vs honor |
| L7 | Nitro path needs zero git homework | Unspoken: you can’t self-enforce |
| L8 | Denon path is agent-default, not lecture-only | Unspoken: he forgets process |
| L9 | This chat / local dirty state doesn’t fake “done” | False confidence |

---

## Results

| Layer | Status | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 Written | **Partial — local only** | Full text in `.worktrees/chore-agent-operator-flow/AGENTS.md` (uncommitted). |
| L2 Committed | **No** | Branch `chore/agent-operator-flow` has `M AGENTS.md`, `M CONTRIBUTING.md`, `?? MESSAGE-DENON…` — **no commit**. |
| L3 On `origin/main` | **No** | Remote `AGENTS.md` has **no** “operator / asymmetric / Denon / Nitro mode”. |
| L3 PR open | **No** | No PR for `chore/agent-operator-flow`. |
| L4 Entry chain | **Weak** | `CLAUDE.md` → “read AGENTS.md” works, but live AGENTS is the **old short** file. `CLAUDE.md` still says *ask the human* to run `pnpm wt` — fights operator mode. |
| L5 Model match | **Draft only** | Asymmetric review is in the **worktree draft** CONTRIBUTING, not on GitHub. Remote CONTRIBUTING still says mutual review. |
| L6 Mechanical | **Partial** | CI yes. Branch protection **no** (Free). `pre-push` mode **644** (may not run). |
| L7 Nitro auto | **Not on main** | Operator mode only in uncommitted worktree draft. |
| L8 Denon auto | **Not on main** | Same. He must also open agents **in this repo** so they read `AGENTS.md`. |
| L9 Dirty local | **Confusing** | Local `main` ahead 1 (token AGENTS commit not necessarily on remote path clarity); uncommitted collab docs; `.worktrees/` present. Easy to think “we already fixed it.” |

### Bottom line in one line

**Drafted in a side folder · not committed · not on GitHub · not what Denon’s next agent will load.**

---

## What *is* already automatic (even without the new draft)

These already live on GitHub `main` and help every agent that reads the repo:

- Worktree rule in `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (stop if main checkout)
- `pnpm verify` before “done”
- Doctrine hard stops in agent protocol
- CI on every PR
- CONTRIBUTING GitHub Flow + `pnpm wt`

So the **base** collab structure is real. What’s **missing** is the **operator loop** (agents do git/PR for Nitro) and **asymmetric review** (don’t wait on Nitro’s Approve).

---

## What “done” looks like (peace of mind checklist)

All must be true:

1. Operator + Denon modes committed  
2. PR opened and **merged to `main`**  
3. `gh api …/AGENTS.md` raw text contains `Nitro operator mode`  
4. `CLAUDE.md` updated so agents **create worktrees / run the loop**, not “ask Nitro to run pnpm wt”  
5. Denon pulled / next agent session on fresh `main`  
6. Optional: `pre-push` executable bit fixed in same PR  

Until 1–3: **do not believe it is automatic.**

---

## What cannot be 100% automatic (honest limits)

| Limit | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| Agents outside this repo | A chat with no project root won’t load `AGENTS.md` |
| Denon ignoring AGENTS | Docs don’t force behavior; CI + habit do |
| Free GitHub | Cannot block merge without review |
| You must open agent **in the project** | Folder context is how rules load |

“All chats forever” = **all chats started on this repo after rules are on `main`**, with agents that load project docs. That is the honest ceiling.

---

## Next action (one)

**Ship the draft:** commit on `chore/agent-operator-flow` → PR → Denon merges → verify remote `AGENTS.md` contains operator mode.

Until you say **ship it**, that step is not done (standing rule: no commit/PR without your ask).
