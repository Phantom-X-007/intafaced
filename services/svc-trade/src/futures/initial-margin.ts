/**
 * Initial margin for a futures open (trade.futures F2 helper), and THE LEVERAGE
 * CEILING.
 *
 * Pure arithmetic: notional / leverage, floored to integer scaled units via
 * ledger Amount bigints. Engine and risk still own whether the open is allowed.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THERE WAS NO CEILING AT ALL, AND THAT IS WHAT THIS FILE IS NOW ALSO FOR
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `grep -rn "MAX_LEVERAGE\|maxLeverage"` returned nothing on this repository.
 * `position-service.ts` took `leverage` off the request body, this function
 * checked that it was `> 0`, and the only ceiling anywhere in the path was an
 * accident of storage: `positions.leverage` is `numeric(8, 2)`, so the platform
 * would accept **999,999.99x** and answer a request for 1,000,000x with a
 * Postgres `22003` numeric overflow surfacing as a 500.
 *
 * That is indefensible on its own terms, before any exploit is involved. It is
 * also the multiplier on one: 100,000x turned ten USDT of margin into a million
 * of notional, and a mark moved 19% against a thin book paid 190,000 out of the
 * profit pot. The depth requirement in `mark-from-depth.ts` is the other half —
 * it makes the mark expensive to manufacture — and neither half is sufficient
 * alone. **This half is what makes the prize bounded and the margin real.**
 *
 * WHAT LEVERAGE ACTUALLY IS, HERE. Margin is `notional / leverage`, and margin
 * is the only money the trader has at risk in an isolated position
 * (`DIRECTION` §1). So leverage is precisely the ratio between what a mark may
 * be asked to pay out on and what its owner stands to lose for being wrong. An
 * unbounded ratio means an unbounded payout against a bounded stake, which is
 * not a leverage product — it is a free option on the house pot.
 *
 * REFUSED, NOT CLAMPED. A request for 500x is not quietly opened at the cap: the
 * caller asked for a position with a different liquidation price than the one
 * they would get, and silently substituting risk parameters is the same class of
 * mistake as silently substituting a price. `docs/adr/2026-08-05-futures-risk-
 * and-mark-law.md` is explicit for prices — *refuse the request, not
 * ignore-and-substitute, so the caller learns* — and a margin requirement is a
 * price the caller pays.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE NUMBER IS THE LISTING OWNER'S.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An absent owner/listing cap is not permission to choose one. It disables
 * position opens and re-leverage while leaving the rest of svc-trade serving.
