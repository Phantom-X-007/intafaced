/**
 * crewMemberCreated → agents crew channel open. NOT WIRED — nothing calls this.
 *
 * `index.ts` connects to NATS and builds a bus, and it has never called
 * `subscribeCrewMemberCreated`. Nothing imports this file except its own unit
 * test, so no crew channel is opened by this code; `MemoryCrewChannelOpener` is
 * a process-local `Map`.
 *
 * This file was nevertheless counted as closing ADR D-S-13's `crewMemberCreated`
 * Class B defect, because `event-wiring` matched the TEXT of `bus.subscribe(…)`,
 * and the catalog's honest socket entry was deleted on that basis. The gate now
 * decides wiring by reachability from the entrypoint, and this file is not
 * reachable, so it counts for nothing and the socket entry is back.
 *
 * Unlike the svc-academy half, this one is a two-line mount away: `index.ts`
 * already has the bus. It is left undone deliberately — ADR D-S-13 puts BOTH
 * named consumers on the owner, and half a close is how the description gets
 * quietly rewritten to match whichever half shipped. See
 * `CLASS_B_AWAITING_A_DECISION` in tooling/ci/event-wiring.mjs.
