# svc-market

Vendor lifecycle for `market.vendors` (§8.7) plus listings and one-time purchase
for `market.commerce`. **A user applies to be a marketplace vendor, an operator
vets the application, an approved vendor holds listing slots their IFC stake
tier pays for, a stranger can see who is listed, a listed vendor publishes a
priced listing, and a buyer pays via ledger recipes with a disclosed house
commission.**

Doctrine: §0.6 no balances here; §2 no SQL into another service's schema; the
stake numbers stay in svc-token; value moves only through `packages/ledger-client`.

## API

tRPC under `/trpc` (edge mounts `/api/market`). Principal via edge HMAC
(`EDGE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET`).

| `history`           | `market:ops`   | The decision trail for one application                    |

HTTP: `GET /health`, `GET /ready` (`stage: commerce-one-time`, plus whether commission is configured).

Neither `claimSlot` nor `releaseSlot` takes a `vendorId`: a slot is always spent
against the caller's own vendor row. A claim that could name its vendor would let
anyone burn somebody else's capacity, and the refusal would land on the victim.

`applyAsVendor` and `mine` carry `{ module: 'market' }`, so the JURISDICTION_MATRIX is
enforced: `market` is OPEN_BASIC, so an applicant needs verification tier
`basic`. The operator procedures deliberately do not — a desk operator's
authority is `market:ops`, not their own KYC tier.

`profile` and `listed` carry neither a scope nor the matrix guard. They are the
shopfront: svc-edge forwards a request with no token as ANONYMOUS, so these
resolve for somebody who has never signed up, which is the whole audience. The
matrix asks "may this USER apply/list here, at their verification tier" and an
anonymous reader is not a user. Halting the module still lands first — `/api/market`
is in svc-edge `UPSTREAMS`, so the kill-switch closes the door in an `onRequest`
hook, before any of this code runs.

### What this service will not decide

**There is no vetting criterion here, and there must not be one.** No rule exists
anywhere in this repository for what makes an application good;
`docs/ops/trk/market.vendors.md` names it an open product question that belongs
to the owner. So `vet` takes an operator's decision and their reason, records
both, and applies the state — a log with a side effect, not a decision engine. A
caller that reaches `VendorService.vet` without holding `market:ops` is refused
with **`market.vet_operator_required`**, including a future policy engine or an
internal script. Precedent: `pay.kyb_operator_required`.

**There are still no stake numbers here.** Slot capacity is READ from svc-token,
never stored. The tier table (`vendorSlots`) belongs to
`services/svc-token/src/economics/staking.ts`, and no threshold, slot count or
tier name appears in this service or its schema — a second copy of a stake
schedule is a second answer to "may this vendor list", and the two diverge on the
first tuning change.

**There is no suspension policy.** `suspended` is a state an operator may set
with a reason. Nothing here decides when that should happen, on a timer or
otherwise. Any transition between decided states is permitted, because a
transition map is itself a policy nobody has ruled on. Stage 2 RELEASES a
vendor's slots when they leave `approved` — reacting to a transition an operator
recorded is not the same as deciding it.

## Stake-gated listing slots (Stage 2)

Capacity is `AccessTier.vendorSlots`, read from svc-token's
`GET /internal/stake/:userId` at claim time and again on every read. Not the tRPC
`token.stakeOf` — that is `scopedProcedure('token:read')` and self-only, and
svc-market does not hold the user's principal.

**Fails closed.** Network throw, non-2xx, an unusable payload, a `vendorSlots`
that is not a non-negative integer — all four refuse with
`market.stake_unavailable` rather than guessing a capacity. `slots` refuses too: a
read that cannot verify entitlement must not report a vendor as listable.

**No amount crosses the boundary.** The endpoint returns `staked` and
`tier.minStake` as decimal strings; this service reads NEITHER, because it needs
a capacity and not a balance. That is also the safest position on the bug PR #1100
fixed — a field that is never read cannot be accidentally re-scaled.

**Depends on PR #1100 (merged).** That PR fixed
`/internal/stake/:userId` returning HTTP 500 for every caller (`AccessTier.minStake`
was a bigint and Fastify's `JSON.stringify` fallback threw). Fail-closed still
holds: any remaining non-2xx / unusable payload is `market.stake_unavailable`,
not free capacity.

### Capacity cannot be oversold

`claimSlot` locks the vendor row `FOR UPDATE`, counts open slots, decides, then
inserts — one transaction at `read committed`, the same pattern as
`svc-academy`'s seat claim. The proof is
`src/vendor-slots.test.ts`: eight simultaneous claims against a tier of three
admit exactly three and refuse five by name. **That suite needs Postgres and
skips without it** — a local run with no Docker has not proved this.

The stake lookup happens **before** the lock, deliberately: it is a network call,
and holding the vendor's busiest row across one would serialise every claim behind
svc-token's latency. A slightly stale ENTITLEMENT can only admit a claim the
vendor was entitled to moments ago; what must be fresh is the OCCUPANCY, and that
is counted inside the lock.

`ref` names what the slot is for and makes a claim idempotent — a retried request
must not consume a second slot for the same listing, which is overselling by a
different route. Stage 3 sets it to a listing id.

### Release, and why there is no unstake subscriber

Slots are released three ways: the vendor releases one, or an operator moves them
out of `approved` (released in the SAME transaction as the transition — split
across two, a crash leaves a suspended vendor holding every slot), or **they stop
counting** because capacity is re-derived on read.

That last one is the honest mechanism for unstaking. svc-market never learns that
somebody unstaked: there is no accepted bus subject for it, `event-wiring.mjs`
correctly reds on a subject with no publisher, and polling svc-token on a timer
would be a second source of truth that is wrong between ticks. So `slots` reports
`usable = min(held, capacity)`, and `0` for anyone not `approved`. A vendor who
drops to Base reads `usable: 0` immediately, which is what makes "under-staked
vendors cannot present as listed" hold whether or not a release ever happened.

## Public list eligibility (Stage 3)

**A vendor is listed if they are approved, hold at least one open slot, and their
CURRENT stake tier still covers at least one of those slots.** Computed on every
read. There is no `is_listed` column and there must not be one, for the reason
`services/svc-p2p/src/reputation.ts` gives about badges — _"a badge that can only
be granted is a badge that lies"_. A stored flag is right until the fact under it
changes and nothing runs, and for unstaking nothing ever runs: svc-market is
never told. The flag would then read `listed` for a vendor whose entitlement is
gone, which is DoD clause 5 failing while looking fine.

The under-staked case is the one the clause exists for. A vendor claims three
slots at Operator, unstakes to Base, and **nothing releases those rows** — Stage 2
deliberately has no unstake subscriber. They are not listed anyway, because
`usableSlots` clamps what they hold to what svc-token says their tier covers this
second. `src/listing-eligibility.test.ts` asserts the three slot rows are still
open before asserting the vendor has vanished from the marketplace, so the test
cannot pass by the rows quietly disappearing.

**A partial drop still leaves them listed**, and that is deliberate: somebody at
Initiate is entitled to a slot. Which of an over-held vendor's listings stays
live is `market.commerce`'s: **oldest open slot first** (`claimed_at ASC`), count
= current usable capacity. Excess listings stay in `myListings` but drop from the
public catalogue and refuse purchase with `market.listing_over_capacity`.

### What a stranger sees

Four fields: `id`, `displayName`, `description`, `createdAt`. Every omission is
argued in `PublicVendorProfile` — no `userId` (joins a storefront to a person's
account across every module), no `status` (always `approved` when a profile
exists, so the only thing it could carry is that somebody else was suspended), no
tier or slot counts (a tier name is a public statement about the size of
somebody's holdings), no slot `ref`s, and **nothing whatsoever from
`market.vendor_status_events`** — the vetting reason, the operator's id and the
scope they held stay behind `market:ops` where Stage 1 put them.

`profile` answers **one NOT_FOUND for every reason**: unknown id, never approved,
suspended, rejected, holds no slot, unstaked. A caller that could tell those apart
could enumerate everybody an operator has thrown off the marketplace.

### The `market.commerce` seam

`VendorService.listingEligibility({ vendorId })` or `({ userId })` — a method, not
only a procedure. **Public catalogue and purchase** re-read it so an unstaked or
suspended vendor cannot present as listed or sell. It returns a verdict with a
code commerce can act on (`market.vendor_not_found`, `market.vendor_not_approved`,
`market.slot_required`, `market.stake_required`) rather than throwing, because a
refusal that arrives as an exception gets flattened into a 500 that tells the
vendor nothing.

**Create listing does not use `listingEligibility`.** A vendor is listed only
after they hold a usable slot; the first listing is what claims that slot.
Create gates on **approved vendor** + successful `claimSlot({ ref: listingId })`.
Using eligibility on create would refuse every first listing with
`market.slot_required` (chicken-and-egg). Purchase and catalogue still require a
live open slot with `ref = listingId`, so a crash between insert and claim cannot
sell an orphan row.

`market.stake_unavailable` is the exception, and it is **thrown**: "we could not
check" is not a finding about the vendor and must never be recorded as one. A
caller handed `stake_required` during an svc-token outage would tell an honest
vendor to go and stake.

### Fail closed, ordered so an outage costs as little as possible

Every locally-decidable fact is settled before the network call, so a suspended
vendor, a rejected one, an unknown id and a vendor with no slot are all answered
**without** svc-token. Only callers whose answer genuinely depends on the stake
read can be affected by an outage.

When it is affected: the directory drops that vendor and keeps going — one flaky
lookup costs one vendor, and a total outage returns an empty page. **Nobody
appears rather than everybody.** The single `profile` read throws instead, and
reaches the caller as a 500: a 404 there would assert the vendor does not exist,
which is false and cacheable. That path is tested against a `node:http` server
returning the exact 500 `GET /internal/stake/:userId` produces on `main` today.

One stake read per candidate, capped at 50 a page. If the directory ever takes
real traffic the upgrade is a **batch** entitlement read on svc-token — never a
cached `is_listed`.

### The order is deliberately boring

`created_at ASC`, tie-broken by id. Registration order: already in the database,
and the public `listings` catalogue uses the same registration order (not newest-first) —
stable under pagination, and it says nothing about how good anybody is. Ranking,
quality scoring and featured placement are reserved to the owner by
`docs/DIRECTION-2026-07-31.md` §8, and choosing one here — even "newest first",
which is a growth choice — would be this service deciding listing policy. A
public list is not a ranked list.

A page can come back shorter than `limit`, because the entitlement filter runs
after it. Back-filling would mean paging svc-token until the page was full, which
turns one slow lookup into an unbounded number of them.

## Events

**None published, none consumed.** No accepted bus subject exists for vendor
lifecycle or market purchases yet. Declaring a subject with no publisher is an
orphan the wiring gate correctly refuses. Unstake has no bus subject either —
eligibility re-reads svc-token live instead.

## Ledger

**Vendors half moves no value.** Slot capacity is not money. **Commerce half**
depends on `@intafaced/ledger-client` and posts only `recipes.marketPurchase`
(buyer → vendor net + `houseFees('market')`). Market tables hold no balances —
price and commission_bps are intent records. The house rate is owner-gated via
`MARKET_HOUSE_COMMISSION_BPS` (no default).

## Schema

`market.vendors` — one row per **user** (`user_id` UNIQUE), the reversible answer
to the org-vs-user question the spec leaves open.

`market.vendor_status_events` — append-only, enforced by a database trigger, with
both sides of every transition, a required non-blank reason, the operator's id
and the scope they held. A correction is a new row, never an edit: a history that
can be rewritten looks like evidence and is not.

`market.vendor_slots` — one row per claimed slot, released by setting
`released_at` rather than by deletion, so occupancy stays a `COUNT` over live rows
instead of a maintained counter that can drift. **No capacity, tier or threshold
column** — that is svc-token's, read live. A partial unique index on
`(vendor_id, ref) WHERE released_at IS NULL` makes "one open slot per listing" a
database fact for any future path that does not take the lock.

A slot table rather than counting listings: Stage 2 shipped before commerce, so
oversell was provable with opaque `ref`s alone. Commerce now writes the listing
id into `ref` on create. Schema also has `market.listings` and `market.purchases`
(migration `0002_market_commerce.sql`).

## Observability

OpenTelemetry spans via `withMarketSpan` (`intafaced.money_path=false`, module
`market`). SLO residual: one Grafana panel for application and decision rates —
ops backlog, not a Stage-1 ship gate.

## Kill-switch

Flags `market.listings` and `market.vendorApplications` are `NOT_ENFORCED` — the
live control is the edge kill-switch, which works because `/api/market` is in
`UPSTREAMS` (`services/svc-edge/src/routes.ts`). Nothing here reads the flags,
and the flag registry's own comment says so out loud rather than implying
otherwise.

## Commerce money path (Class M)

| Recipe           | Reason            | Accounts                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `marketPurchase` | `market.purchase` | buyer available → vendor available + `houseFees('market')` |

- **Idempotency:** `market.purchase:<purchaseId>` (client-supplied).
- **Commission:** `MARKET_HOUSE_COMMISSION_BPS` — **no default**. Unset refuses
  `market.commission_not_configured` before any row or post. `0` is an explicit
  free rate, not silence.
- **Rounding:** floor on commission (customer favour); buyer pays exactly the
  listed price (vendor net + house = price).
- **Eligibility:** catalogue and purchase re-check `listingEligibility` plus a
  live slot `ref = listingId` — never a stored `is_listed`. Create uses
  approved + `claimSlot` (see seam above). Purchase re-checks again immediately
  before the ledger post (stake/suspend TOCTOU close).
- **Crash re-drive:** a pending purchase settles from the **claim snapshot**
  (price + commission_bps on the row), not a later env rate. Settle updates only
  while `status = 'pending'`.
- **Subscriptions:** listing `offer_type=subscription` is storable; **public
  catalogue omits them** until Stage C3; purchase refuses
  `market.subscription_not_built` (needs product law).

No balance column exists on `market.listings` or `market.purchases`. Price and
commission_bps are intent records; the only balances live in svc-ledger.
