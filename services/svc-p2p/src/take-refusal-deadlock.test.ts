/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A REFUSED TAKE MUST NOT COST A CONNECTION IT IS ALREADY HOLDING
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * #805 closed an enumeration oracle in `trades.take` and, in closing it, opened
 * a remote denial of service that ten requests are enough to make permanent.
 *
 * The refusal throws, and the throw aborts `reserveTrade`'s transaction — so a
 * log row written on `tx` would roll back with it, and "unlogged" was the whole
 * defect. #805 therefore wrote the row on `this.sql`, the service's pool. That
 * is right about durability and wrong about connections: `refuseTake` runs
 * INSIDE the transaction, the transaction is holding a pool connection, and the
 * INSERT asks the same pool for a second one.
 *
 * `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` defaults to 10 (`packages/config/src/env.ts`). Ten
 * concurrent refused takes against ten DIFFERENT offers therefore hold all ten
 * connections and each queues for an eleventh that will never exist. The
 * transactions sit `idle in transaction`: no statement is running, so
 * `statement_timeout` cannot fire, and postgres.js's client-side queue has no
 * timeout of its own. Nothing unwinds it. The service stops answering, and the
 * ten offer rows stay locked, so those ten offers die with it.
 *
 * The attack needs ten `trades.take` calls naming a method the offers do not
 * list. `methodAllowed` is checked BEFORE the bounds check, so it needs no
 * funds, no valid amount, and no payment instrument. (Ten takes against the
 * SAME offer serialise on `FOR UPDATE` and recover; distinct offers is the
 * permanent case, and it is the one below.)
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS SEPARATE
 *
 *   1 · N concurrent refused takes against N distinct offers all settle, and
 *       the service still serves an unrelated request afterwards.
 *   2 · Every one of them is still on the record — #805's guarantee has to
 *       survive the fix, and under concurrency, not just one at a time.
 *   3 · They are still indistinguishable — the fix must not reopen the oracle.
 *
 * It is its own file, on its OWN DATABASE, for a reason the sibling suites do
 * not have: it deliberately saturates a connection pool. Sharing `intafaced_test`
 * with ~150 worktrees while doing that is antisocial at best, and on the broken
 * code it leaves ten backends wedged `idle in transaction` holding row locks —
 * on a shared database that is somebody else's flaky red. `createTestDatabase`
 * stamps this run its own `itf_run_p2p_<pid>_<n>_<rand>_test`, dropped WITH
 * (FORCE) in `afterAll`, so the wedged backends are terminated with it. The
 * pool it saturates is its own and is bounded at POOL_MAX.
 *
 * H8a PG-hard: this file never `describe.skip` / `postgresAvailable`. CI uses
 * TEST_DATABASE_URL (per-run database via `createTestDatabase` so schema-qualified
 * `p2p.*` SQL stays on `p2p`). Local without that env starts Testcontainers
 * `postgres:16-alpine`. Docker/PG down is a failed suite, not a green skip.
