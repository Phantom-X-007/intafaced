# Overnight run status — 2026-07-30 (compaction brace)

**Read this first after compact / new chat.** Live git always wins if this disagrees.

## Live truth (re-check)

```bash
export GH_TOKEN="$(tr -d '\n\r ' < ~/.grok/agent-auth/github_token)"
git fetch origin main
git log origin/main -8 --oneline
gh pr list --state open
gh run list --branch main --limit 3
```

## What “right way” means tonight

| Do | Don't |
| --- | --- |
| O1 babysit with merge matrix (money = no Nitro merge) | Invent futures / OTC / rails / multi-asset |
| O2 Stream A honesty against **already shipped** spine | Resume crash-WIP `feat/spine-*` without Denon |
| WAVE-AUDIT + high water honesty | Rubber-stamp Denon money PRs |
| Class N: audit → fix → prove → merge | Claim CI green from local-only artefacts |
| Worktrees only | Edit main checkout |

## Denon handovers vs live (corrected)

| Claim in chat | Live at this fire |
| --- | --- |
| Main da329d3 / 2f6ab47 | Advanced: **`2e0bb87`** (#220 on tip) |
| Token factory + indexer still branches | **Merged** #217 #218; CI fix #221 |
| Zero open PRs | **True** at fire start |
| blueprint cascade done | **False** — honesty residual stands |
| CI dead / billing | **CI back** — tip Actions SUCCESS |

## Past Grok session caliber

| Session theme | Caliber |
| --- | --- |
| AFK cook / parallel grind (`019fae3d`) | High volume product micro → drained; babysit Denon wave; mega audits |
| Stream A owner (`019fb069`) | Shell :8090 claim; uiproof floor |
| Frontend research (`019fb1ac`) | Blueprint / leverage docs (not product code) |
| Overnight O1+O2 arm (`#219` / prior chat) | Law + merge matrix + bank loans shell #220 |

**Autonomous stage now:** **O1+O2**, not unbounded COOK. Backend micro-queue **DRAINED** on purpose.

## Owner-only (do not agent-fake)

- Rotate disclosed secrets (heapdump credential in history)  
- TradingView licence path  
- Sanctions list content + counsel  
- Dual-book / balance-ownership ADR decision  
- Real EVM RPC / mainnet  
- Multi-asset instruments merge  

## Ship set this fire

1. Hygiene PR — wave audit archive + grind high water + LIVE-LANES  
2. Stream A PR — Academy/Launch pages; Protocol/Chain honesty; Blueprint card; Pay health  

## If compact mid-run

1. This file + `docs/GRIND-LOOP-ACTIVE.md` on `origin/main`  
2. `gh pr list` — finish any open Class N with verify → merge  
3. Do **not** re-implement #110–#221
