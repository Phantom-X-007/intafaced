/**
 * LATENCY GRADING — §27's "every adapter continuously scored — round-trip, book
 * staleness, reject rates — feeding execution routing weights live".
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT A GRADE IS FOR
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A venue does not fail cleanly. It gets slow, then it gets slower, then some
 * requests start being rejected, and long before it is "down" it has become the
 * wrong venue to send an order to. Health as a boolean cannot express any of
 * that, so a fabric with only a boolean discovers the degradation by routing
 * into it.
 *
 * The grade is the continuous version of the boolean, and it is deliberately
 * computed from three independent signals, because each catches a failure the
 * others miss:
 *
 *   · **Round-trip p95, not the mean.** The mean is dominated by the fast
 *     majority; the tail is what an order actually experiences when it matters.
 *     A venue with a 30ms mean and a 4s p95 is a venue that will hang on the
 *     one request you cannot afford to have hang.
 *   · **Reject rate.** A venue answering fast and refusing half of what it is
 *     sent is worse than a slow one that works, and pure latency scores it
 *     top of the list.
 *   · **Staleness.** The failure that actually costs money: a venue that has
 *     stopped updating still answers, still quotes, and still looks fine — right
 *     up until the fill comes back at a price from thirty seconds ago.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THREE STATES, NOT TWO — `ungraded` vs `provisional` vs graded
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * These are routinely confused and they are not the same claim:
 *
 *   · **ungraded** (`grade: null`) — NO evidence. Nothing has been observed in
 *     the window. We say so, rather than scoring it. See the `latency.ts` header
 *     in `@intafaced/venue-contracts` for why this is `null` and emphatically
 *     not `'F'`, and for D-S-18, the Accepted ADR that requires it.
 *   · **provisional** — THIN evidence. Two samples do not make a p95, and a
 *     grader that answered "A" on two fast reads would be inventing confidence
 *     the router would then act on. The letter is returned, because an honest
 *     weak signal beats no signal, but it is labelled and it is not allowed to
 *     exclude a venue by itself.
 *   · **graded** — enough evidence for the letter to mean something.
 *
 * A consumer branches on `isGraded` first and `provisional` second. Branching on
 * `provisional` alone silently lumps "never measured" in with "barely measured".
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * HOW IT FEEDS ROUTING, WITHOUT BREAKING BEST EXECUTION
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The grade does NOT adjust prices. `router.ts` ranks on effective price, and
 * `internalPreference` is the ONE documented thumb on that scale; a second,
 * latency-shaped thumb would quietly become a way to prefer whichever venue we
 * happened to be measuring favourably.
 *
 * What it does instead is set `VenueHealth` — `healthy` and `latencyMs` — which
 * the existing router already consumes: an unhealthy venue is EXCLUDED AND
 * REPORTED in `RoutePlan.rejected` (§27's requirement, exactly), and `latencyMs`
 * breaks ties between venues at the same price. That wiring is two functions:
 * `routingWeightFromGrade` (score-feed eligibility — unscored is **zero**) and
 * `healthFromGrade` (turns weight zero into `healthy: false` the router already
 * understands).
 *
 * Producing the grade is this file's job. CONSUMING it — an §28 cost model that
 * requires a graded latency term alongside fees, expected impact and transfer
 * cost — lives in `cost-model.ts` / `planRoute({ costTermsByVenue })`
 * (D26-P1-X3). §28:770 makes the grade ONE INPUT to that model, never a ranking
 * rule of its own, and D-S-06 leaves the bounded, tested 5 bps internal
 * tie-break in `router.ts` as the only permitted preference. A second
 * latency-shaped ranking rule is therefore not a matter of taste here; it is
 * forbidden. Connect's score feed stops at eligibility weight (D26-P1-X2):
 * unscored → 0. Letter→bps scaling stays an owner magnitude (D-S-14), not
 * invented on this surface.
 */

/**
 * Turn a grade into the `VenueHealth` the router already consumes.
 *
 * This is the entire "feeding routing weights live" wiring, and it is one
 * function on purpose. An `F` becomes `healthy: false`, which the router turns
 * into a `RejectedVenue` with a reason — §27's "excluded and reported", using
 * machinery that already exists rather than a parallel path that could disagree
 * with it.
 *
 * `latencyMs` carries p95, not p50 or the mean. The router uses it to break ties
 * at equal price, and the venue you want at equal price is the one whose SLOW
 * requests are least slow.
 *
 * A `provisional` grade is never allowed to mark a venue unhealthy on its own:
 * excluding a venue on two samples would take real liquidity off the router for
 * no evidence. It can still be F for staleness, which needs no sample count.
 *
 * ── UNGRADED IS NOT PERMISSION TO ROUTE ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The asymmetry in `venue-contracts/latency.ts` is enforced here. An ungraded
 * venue is not given a bad grade, but it is NOT routable either — D-S-18's
 * second clause is "an unscored adapter must not receive routing weight". So
 * `grade: null` produces `healthy: false`, and the two statements coexist
 * without contradiction: we do not claim the venue is slow, we decline to route
 * to a venue we have not measured.
 *
 * ── `UNMEASURED_LATENCY_MS` IS A SENTINEL, AND IT ONLY SORTS ONE WAY ─────────
 *
 * `VenueHealth.latencyMs` is a required `number` (`source.ts`), shared with
 * every other rail in the repo, so "no measurement" has no `null` to use here
 * and something must be written. That is the one place this file cannot follow
 * the refuse-rather-than-fabricate rule to the letter, so the mitigation is
 * directional rather than representational:
 *
 * The sentinel is the MAXIMUM safe integer, and `router.ts` sorts `latencyMs`
 * ASCENDING at its tie-break. An unmeasured venue therefore always loses a tie
 * it participates in — it can never be preferred on a latency it does not have.
 * Being wrong in the conservative direction is the whole of the guarantee.
 *
 * It is emitted in two cases, and only one of them is also `healthy: false`:
 *
 *   · ungraded — no observations at all. Excluded, so it never reaches ranking.
 *   · graded, but with no SUCCESSFUL observation (every call errored). If that
 *     grade is `provisional`, the venue stays healthy on too-few-samples and
 *     does carry the sentinel into ranking — where, per the above, it loses.
 *
 * Both are pinned by tests. If a future change ever flips that sort to
 * descending, or gives the sentinel a small value, an unmeasured venue starts
 * winning tie-breaks on money — so those pins are load-bearing, not decorative.
