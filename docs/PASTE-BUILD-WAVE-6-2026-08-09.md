# BUILD LANE L01 — AGENTS residual · wave 6 · long cook · go all out

You are Claude Code on INTAFACED (`~/projects/Sovereign` → `Phantom-X-007/intafaced`).
Nitro is AFK. **Token cost is not a constraint for residual work.**
**1 of 16** path-walled lanes are live. You own **only** your wall.

## 0 · Auth + tip ritual (every cycle)

export PATH="/Users/Nitro/projects/Sovereign/.tools/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"

git fetch origin
git log -1 --oneline origin/main
gh pr list --state open --limit 60
node tooling/ci/claim-check.mjs <paths>   # unsandboxed
```

- Never print GH_TOKEN. Unsandbox gh / claim-check.
- **Never edit main checkout.** `pnpm wt feat/w6-<lane>-<slice>` from origin/main.
- Thrift deleted on tip — ignore stale HARD thrift.
- Paste-time tip: `8da2c561` — **tip wins**. Stop notes are hypotheses.
- Open PRs (re-derive): ~60 open — babysit first: stop PRs #1384 PAY #1395 TRADE #1396 INDEXER #1352 WS #1361 LEDGER #1373 P2P · market #1189/#1387 commerce · identity cluster · shell/ws/notify tests · #1177 Shehzad · dependabot holds — re-derive
- Fan-out: judgment strong; bulk harvest parallel; no escalate-on-uncertainty thrash. Class M always adversarial.
- **Wave 6:** Wave 5 largely banked with parked residuals + many open stop/product PRs. **Babysit your wall's open PRs first** (including docs stop PRs). Fix monorepo red only if **your** suite broke tip — do not dual-write sibling services to clear their red. Do not invent §8.

## Unit card (mandatory before code)

1. Promise quoted (file:line / ADR / SPEC / W5 stop)
2. Reachable break
3. **Done bar**
4. Class N / P / M / X
5. Paths (packages one-writer if touched)
6. RED test first
7. Collision list vs open PR files

### Class M body (when money)

Self-audit: money path? ledger recipes? no balances outside ledger? no money in number?  
Adversarial: replay · crash mid-write · hostile caller · dark dependency — PR body before merge.

## Parallel recipe

1. **8–12 read-only subagents** first half hour
2. Rank: **merge open PRs on wall** → W5 parked → new residual → never greenfield without Done bar
3. **3–5 worktrees hot**
4. Next unit while CI runs
5. Compact → rebuild from git/gh only
6. Cross-service: **contracts/events PR first**
7. Tracker: mountain-event only
8. `pnpm verify` before push; CI seal
9. PR titles: plain words for Nitro

## Loop

```
while true:
  fetch tip · open PRs · path-intersect · claim-check
  merge your greens
  pick highest CLEAR unit with unit card
  RED → implement → verify → PR → adversarial if M → merge
  start next stream while CI runs
  after compact: rebuild from git/gh only
```

## Banned stops

todo empty · free=0 · thrift · "want me to continue?" · wait for Nitro except Class X / blank §8 / grant authority · idle without real collision · "fixing" sibling suites outside your wall

## Real stop

You are Claude Code on INTAFACED (`~/projects/Sovereign` → `Phantom-X-007/intafaced`).

## Unit card (mandatory before code)

Adversarial: replay · crash mid-write · hostile caller · dark dependency — PR body before merge.

## Parallel recipe

You are Claude Code on INTAFACED (`~/projects/Sovereign` → `Phantom-X-007/intafaced`).
Nitro is AFK. **Token cost is not a constraint for residual work.**
**9 of 16** path-walled lanes are live. You own **only** your wall.

```

- Never print GH_TOKEN. Unsandbox gh / claim-check.
- **Never edit main checkout.** `pnpm wt feat/w6-<lane>-<slice>` from origin/main.
- Thrift deleted on tip — ignore stale HARD thrift.
- Paste-time tip: `8da2c561` — **tip wins**. Stop notes are hypotheses.
- Open PRs (re-derive): ~60 open — babysit first: stop PRs #1384 PAY #1395 TRADE #1396 INDEXER #1352 WS #1361 LEDGER #1373 P2P · market #1189/#1387 commerce · identity cluster · shell/ws/notify tests · #1177 Shehzad · dependabot holds — re-derive

- **Wave 6:** Wave 5 largely banked with parked residuals + many open stop/product PRs. **Babysit your wall's open PRs first** (including docs stop PRs). Fix monorepo red only if **your** suite broke tip — do not dual-write sibling services to clear their red. Do not invent §8.

## Unit card (mandatory before code)

2. Reachable break
3. **Done bar**
4. Class N / P / M / X
5. Paths (packages one-writer if touched)
6. RED test first
7. Collision list vs open PR files

### Class M body (when money)

Self-audit: money path? ledger recipes? no balances outside ledger? no money in number?  
Adversarial: replay · crash mid-write · hostile caller · dark dependency — PR body before merge.

## Parallel recipe

1. **8–12 read-only subagents** first half hour
2. Rank: **merge open PRs on wall** → W5 parked → new residual → never greenfield without Done bar
3. **3–5 worktrees hot**
4. Next unit while CI runs
5. Compact → rebuild from git/gh only
6. Cross-service: **contracts/events PR first**
7. Tracker: mountain-event only
8. `pnpm verify` before push; CI seal
9. PR titles: plain words for Nitro

## Loop

```
while true:
  fetch tip · open PRs · path-intersect · claim-check

- Never print GH_TOKEN. Unsandbox gh / claim-check.
- **Never edit main checkout.** `pnpm wt feat/w6-<lane>-<slice>` from origin/main.
- Thrift deleted on tip — ignore stale HARD thrift.
- Paste-time tip: `8da2c561` — **tip wins**. Stop notes are hypotheses.
- Open PRs (re-derive): ~60 open — babysit first: stop PRs #1384 PAY #1395 TRADE #1396 INDEXER #1352 WS #1361 LEDGER #1373 P2P · market #1189/#1387 commerce · identity cluster · shell/ws/notify tests · #1177 Shehzad · dependabot holds — re-derive
- Fan-out: judgment strong; bulk harvest parallel; no escalate-on-uncertainty thrash. Class M always adversarial.
- **Wave 6:** Wave 5 largely banked with parked residuals + many open stop/product PRs. **Babysit your wall's open PRs first** (including docs stop PRs). Fix monorepo red only if **your** suite broke tip — do not dual-write sibling services to clear their red. Do not invent §8.

## Unit card (mandatory before code)

1. Promise quoted (file:line / ADR / SPEC / W5 stop)
2. Reachable break
3. **Done bar**
4. Class N / P / M / X
5. Paths (packages one-writer if touched)
6. RED test first
7. Collision list vs open PR files

### Class M body (when money)

Self-audit: money path? ledger recipes? no balances outside ledger? no money in number?  
Adversarial: replay · crash mid-write · hostile caller · dark dependency — PR body before merge.

## Parallel recipe

1. **8–12 read-only subagents** first half hour
2. Rank: **merge open PRs on wall** → W5 parked → new residual → never greenfield without Done bar
3. **3–5 worktrees hot**
4. Next unit while CI runs
5. Compact → rebuild from git/gh only
6. Cross-service: **contracts/events PR first**
7. Tracker: mountain-event only
8. `pnpm verify` before push; CI seal
9. PR titles: plain words for Nitro

## Loop

```
while true:
  fetch tip · open PRs · path-intersect · claim-check
  merge your greens
  pick highest CLEAR unit with unit card
  RED → implement → verify → PR → adversarial if M → merge
  start next stream while CI runs
  after compact: rebuild from git/gh only
```

## Banned stops

todo empty · free=0 · thrift · "want me to continue?" · wait for Nitro except Class X / blank §8 / grant authority · idle without real collision · "fixing" sibling suites outside your wall

## Real stop

≥8 Engine A shipped or parked with pick-up · Engine B chapter pass · stop note docs PR · nothing uncommitted →

## Exclusive wall (YOURS)

`vendor/**` except L11 desk in flight

## Fenced

L11 desk UX · TS service money

**Siblings W6:** L01 AGENTS · L02 ACADEMY · L03 P2P · L04 PAY · L05 TRADE · L06 BANK · L07 MARKET · L08 NOTIFY · L09 INDEXER · L10 WS · L11 SHELL · L12 IDENTITY · L13 TOKEN · L14 LEDGER · L15 BOARD+TOOLING · L16 VENDOR-SUPPLY.

## Sealed — do not re-ship (re-verify)

W5 SAFE yes — HOLD #1142/#1146 · NOTICE · Grade C admin residual.

## Read first

1. LANE-STOP-L16-W5 2. dependabot holds 3. money-scan allowlist #1338

## Engine A — Ranked residual (≥8 rows, Done bar each)

| Prio | Unit                                 | Done bar (start — tighten from law) |

| A0   | #1142/#1146 compile-proof or close   | no blind merge                      |
| A1   | money-scan allowlist header residual | #1338 class                         |
| A1   | Grade C admin controllers residual   | dual-book                           |

| A3   | stop note supply matrix              |                                     |

## Engine B — Promise falsification (UNBOUNDED)

scan scripts · barriers · known writes · Dependabot policy · allowlist headers.

## Engine C — Matrix / attack surface

HIGH advisories · DAO mutators · mainnet constants · mint paths.

## Nitro-only (never invent)

Licence/counsel Class X

GO — tip ritual · babysit open PRs · harvest · unit cards · multi-stream · no second briefing.
