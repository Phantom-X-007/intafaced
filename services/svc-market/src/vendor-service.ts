/**
 * THE VENDOR LIFECYCLE — APPLY, THEN VET (Stage 1), AND THE STAKE-GATED LISTING
 * SLOTS THAT SIT ON TOP OF IT (Stage 2) — §8.7, `market.vendors`.
 *
 * A user applies to be a marketplace vendor; an operator decides. Every decision
 * is recorded next to the state it produced, in one transaction, so "why was
 * this vendor rejected" is answerable from the database.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * IT DOES NOT DECIDE WHETHER AN APPLICATION IS GOOD. There is no criterion here,
 * no score, no automatic transition and nothing that calls this on a timer. No
 * vetting criterion exists anywhere in this repository — `market.vendors.md`
 * names it an open product question that belongs to the owner — so the API is
 * deliberately shaped like a log with a side effect rather than a decision
 * engine: an operator names the outcome and a reason, and this records it and
 * applies it. If a policy ever gets written, it CALLS this; it does not live in
 * it. Same posture, and mostly the same words, as
 * `services/svc-pay/src/merchant-state-service.ts` — which exists because
 * merchant state was enforced by a column nothing ever wrote.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT DECIDE WHEN TO SUSPEND EITHER, and Stage 2 does not change that.
 * A slot is released when a vendor stops being approved, but the TRANSITION is
 * still something an operator recorded through `vet`. Reacting to a state
 * somebody else wrote is not the same thing as deciding it, and nothing here
 * suspends a vendor on a timer, a threshold or an offence count.
 *
 * IT STILL RESTATES NO STAKE NUMBER. Stage 2 reads slot capacity from svc-token
 * at claim time (`stake-source.ts`); the tier schedule itself stays in
 * `economics/staking.ts`. No threshold, slot count or tier name is written down
 * in this service or its schema, and `docs/ops/trk/market.vendors.md:76` is why:
 * "market must not invent parallel stake numbers".
 *
 * IT MOVES NO VALUE. There is no import of `@intafaced/ledger-client` in this
 * service and no column in its schema could hold an amount (§0.6). Purchases,
 * subscriptions and house commission are `market.commerce`. Stage 2 deliberately
 * reads only `tier.vendorSlots` off svc-token and ignores the `staked` and
 * `minStake` amounts it also returns, so no money crosses into this process at
 * all.
 *
 * ── WHY THE TWO WRITES ARE ONE TRANSACTION ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `vendors.status` and the history row are written together or not at all. The
 * failure modes if they were not are asymmetric in an ugly way:
 *
 *   · status without history — a vendor is rejected and nobody can say why.
 *     Exactly the defect this table exists to prevent, reintroduced by a crash.
 *   · history without status — the log says a vendor was approved and they are
 *     not. The log is then WORSE than no log, because it looks like evidence and
 *     is false.
 *
 * The vendor row is locked FOR UPDATE first, so `from_status` is the status that
 * was actually in force when the change applied and not one read a moment
 * earlier by a different request.

 * Four fields, and the omissions are the design. Everything left out was left

 * here will be adding it to an UNAUTHENTICATED response:
 *
 *   · `userId` — the platform account id behind the vendor. Publishing it joins
 *     a marketplace storefront to a person's account across every other module.
 *     `market.commerce` references a VENDOR, and that is the id it gets.
 *   · `status` — redundant and dangerous at once. A profile only exists when the
 *     vendor is listed, so it would always read `approved`; the only thing it
 *     could ever carry is the information that somebody ELSE was suspended.
 *   · the vetting reason, `actorId`, `actorScope`, and anything at all from
 *     `market.vendor_status_events` — operator-internal. "Rejected: suspected
 *     counterfeit stock" is a defamation-shaped disclosure and Stage 1 put that
 *     table behind `market:ops` deliberately. `history` stays the only reader.
 *   · the stake TIER, capacity, and held/usable slot counts — a tier name is a
 *     public statement about the size of someone's holdings. svc-market reads
 *     `vendorSlots` to decide, and then does not repeat what it learned.
 *   · slot `ref`s — Stage 2 reserved those for `market.commerce` listing ids.
 *     Which of a vendor's listings are live is commerce's surface to publish.
 *
 * `createdAt` is when the APPLICATION was made, not when it was approved. The
 * approval date is only derivable from the operator event log, and reading that
 * table to render a public page is the first step towards leaking it.

   *
   * A CALLER THAT IS NOT AN OPERATOR — `market.vet_operator_required`. The
   * router already gates the procedure on the scope, so this looks redundant and
   * is not: the point of the refusal is that NOTHING in this codebase may decide
   * an application. A future policy engine, an internal tool or a script that
   * reached this method directly would otherwise write an approval with no human
   * behind it, and the audit row would record a scope that never authorised
   * anything. The precedent is `payment-service.ts`'s `decideKybStub`, which
   * refuses under live-only with `pay.kyb_operator_required` rather than
   * inventing an external vendor's answer.
   *
   * A BLANK REASON. Enforced here so the operator gets a sentence rather than a
   * constraint-violation string, and enforced again by a CHECK in the database
   * so it holds for anything that ever writes that table without coming through
   * here. Two checks: the first is for the operator, the second is for the
   * guarantee.
   *
   * A NO-OP. Setting a vendor to the status they already hold appends nothing
   * and changes nothing. It is not an error — an operator clicking twice is not
   * a fault — but it must not write a row, because a history full of
   * `approved → approved` is a history nobody reads, and a history nobody reads
   * is how the real rows get missed.
   *
   * ── WHAT IT DOES NOT REFUSE, AND WHY ───────────────────────────────────────

   * vendor, reinstating a suspended one, approving a previously rejected
   * application — all permitted. That looks lax and is the deliberate half of
   * "do not invent a suspension policy": a transition map is a policy. It would
   * decide that rejection is final, that a suspension cannot be lifted, and half
   * a dozen other things nobody has ruled on. What the history buys is that

   * A capacity is only a capacity if two requests racing for the last slot
   * cannot both get it. The insert runs inside a transaction that locks the
   * VENDOR row first, so the occupancy count and the insert cannot interleave —
   * which is what makes `read committed` correct here (packages/db/src/
   * connection.ts explains when it is and when it is not). Same pattern, and
   * mostly the same words, as `svc-academy`'s seat claim.
   *
   * ── WHY THE STAKE READ HAPPENS BEFORE THE LOCK ─────────────────────────────
   *
   * Deliberately, and it is the subtle half. A stake lookup is a network call to
   * svc-token. Holding the vendor's row across one would serialise every claim
   * that vendor makes behind svc-token's latency, and under an outage it would
   * hold the lock for the full fetch timeout. The capacity read a few
   * milliseconds early is not a correctness problem: the number it produces is
   * an ENTITLEMENT, and a stale entitlement can only ever admit a claim the
   * vendor was entitled to moments ago. What must not be stale is the OCCUPANCY,
   * and that is counted inside the lock.

   * ── THE SEAM `market.commerce` CALLS ───────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * A service METHOD and not only a router procedure, because the consumer named
   * by the DoD ("feeds `market.commerce` listing create — refuse if not
   * listed/eligible") is another service's write path, not a browser. Commerce
   * asks by `userId` — a vendor creating a listing arrives as a principal, and
   * `market.commerce` has no reason to know svc-market's vendor id. The public
   * profile asks by `vendorId`. Both keys, one rule.
   *
   * ── ELIGIBILITY IS COMPUTED, NEVER STORED ──────────────────────────────────
   *
   * There is no `is_listed` column and there must not be one, for the reason
   * `services/svc-p2p/src/reputation.ts:71-75` already gives about badges: "a
   * badge that can only be granted is a badge that lies". A stored flag is
   * correct exactly until the fact under it changes and nothing runs — which for
   * unstaking is ALWAYS, because svc-market never learns that somebody unstaked
   * (no bus subject, no publisher, and polling would be a second source of truth
   * that is wrong between ticks). The flag would then say `listed` about a vendor
   * whose entitlement is gone, which is DoD clause 5 failing while looking fine.
   *
   * ── THE ORDER OF THE CHECKS IS LOAD-BEARING TWICE ──────────────────────────
   *
   * Every cheap local fact is settled before the network call. That is not only
   * a latency choice: it means a suspended vendor, a rejected one, an unknown id
   * and a vendor holding no slot are all answered WITHOUT svc-token, so an
   * svc-token outage cannot turn those into a 500. The only callers who reach the
   * stake read are the ones whose answer genuinely depends on it.
   *
   * ── WHAT IT THROWS RATHER THAN RETURNS, AND WHY THAT IS THE POINT ──────────
   *
   * Every finding ABOUT THE VENDOR is a returned value. `market.stake_unavailable`
   * is THROWN, because "we could not check" is not a finding about the vendor and
   * must never be recorded as one: a caller handed `{ listed: false, code:
   * 'market.stake_required' }` during an svc-token outage would tell an honest
   * vendor to go and stake, and a caller that logged it would log a mass
   * unstaking that never happened. Callers still fail CLOSED on it — the profile
   * read below shows a vendor nothing, and the directory drops them — but they do
   * it knowing the difference.
