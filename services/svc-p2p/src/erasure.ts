/**
 * P2P EXPORT AND ERASURE — stage 1 (§0.9 · GDPR Art. 15 / Art. 17).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE: NOTHING.
 *
 * `blueprint.export` / `blueprint.erase` are real, self-only and a genuine hard
 * delete — and every statement in them is prefixed `blueprint.`. No p2p table
 * is covered by anything. There is no platform-wide erasure orchestrator, no
 * per-service erase convention, and svc-p2p subscribes to no events at all, so
 * it could not hear an account-deletion signal if one existed.
 *
 * The de facto answers were `instruments.reveal` for export and
 * `instruments.remove` for erase — one instrument at a time, only while active,
 * and covering none of the offers, trades, disputes or reputation this service
 * holds about a person.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE TWO RULES THIS FILE IS BUILT ON
 *
 * 1 · **Never erase something the platform still owes an answer about.** A
 *     trade holding escrow, an open dispute, a decision recorded but not yet
 *     settled — deleting our copy of the terms while svc-ledger still holds the
 *     value is how escrow becomes a pile of money with no owner and no
 *     instruction. That is the exact stranded-funds condition the whole service
 *     is built to prevent, and "the user asked" does not make it safe.
 *
 * 2 · **Say what was kept, and why, in the response.** An erase that silently
 *     retains half the record is worse than one that refuses: the person
 *     believes something that is not true, and only finds out in a dispute.
 *     Every call returns a `retained` manifest naming each category, the count,
 *     and the reason — and the reasons here are honest ones ("a settled trade
 *     is the audit trail for a movement of value") rather than "compliance".
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT STAGE 1 DOES NOT DO, stated here rather than discovered later:
 *
 *   · **Settled trades are retained, not pseudonymised.** Replacing a user id
 *     with a surrogate everywhere it appears is a migration across every row
 *     that references it, and getting it half-right leaves a trade whose two
 *     sides disagree about who traded. Stage 3, and it needs the owner's answer
 *     on how long a settled P2P trade must remain attributable.
 *   · **There is no cross-service orchestration.** This is reachable only by
 *     the person themselves. When a platform-wide erasure signal exists, this
 *     is what it calls.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS — the thing this file was written before and now covers.
 *
 * The first version of this file said instruments were "not yet built". They
 * are: `payment_instruments` holds the account number a seller is paid at, and
 * it is the single most sensitive row in the service. An erase that leaves it
 * there and does not say so is exactly the "silently retains half the record"
 * failure this file is built to refuse.
 *
 * It is erased the way the instrument table already defines erasure — a state
 * change to `removed`, which the `payment_instruments_details_ck` CHECK turns
 * into "details IS NULL" at the database. Not a DELETE: the access log and the
 * frozen trade snapshots both carry foreign keys to the row, and deleting it
 * would take the record of who looked at the details away with the details.
 * The `fingerprint` deliberately survives — an appeal can still be told whether
 * the account a seller now names is the one the buyer was shown, without us
 * holding the account in order to answer.
 *
 * The frozen snapshots on the caller's OWN trades are purged on the same tick
 * rather than left to `purgeExpiredSnapshots` — the retention window is how
 * long we keep them when nobody asked; somebody asked. Snapshots owned by a
 * COUNTERPARTY are not touched: those are that person's account details, on a
 * trade they did not ask to be erased from.
