/**
 * RUN LEDGER - durable memory for an autonomous run.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The coordinator compacted 22 times across 8.8M tokens and merged 64 near
 * identical PRs without ever noticing it was repeating itself. Nothing on disk
 * held "what I already did", so every compaction started it over. Craft rule:
 * status/disk is memory, context death is expected, resume from the ledger
 * (~/projects/OS/graph-engineering/CRAFT.md #10).
 *
 * WHY NOT docs/AUTONOMOUS-RUN.md
 * ------------------------------
 * That file already tried this on 2026-07-27 and has the right shape - id,
 * status, proof, terminal-only stop rule. It failed for one reason: it was
 * MAINTAINED BY THE MODEL BY HAND, and nothing has written it since the day it
 * was created. The failure autopsy records it as "lagged / lied mid-flight".
 * So this ledger is written by CODE at every transition, never by an agent
 * deciding to remember. AUTONOMOUS-RUN.md stays as the historical record of
 * that run and points here.
 *
 * WHY THE FILE IS GITIGNORED
 * --------------------------
 * It is runtime state, not law. Committing it would mean a commit and ~5 CI
 * runs per status transition. Precedent: docs/ops/FREEZE-LIVE.json is ignored
 * the same way. The LAW - that the ledger exists and must be read before
 * choosing work - lives in AGENTS.md, which is in-repo and gate-enforced.
 *
 * DURABILITY
 * ----------
 * Every write is tmp -> fsync -> rename. rename(2) is atomic within a
 * filesystem, so a crash mid-write leaves the previous good file intact rather
 * than a truncated one. This is the single gap the graph-engineering audit said
 * to close first if a runner were ever built.
 *
 * USE
 *   node tooling/scripts/run-ledger.mjs open   <id> <type> [note]
 *   node tooling/scripts/run-ledger.mjs start  <id> [branch]
 *   node tooling/scripts/run-ledger.mjs pr     <id> <url>
 *   node tooling/scripts/run-ledger.mjs done   <id> <url>      # url REQUIRED
 *   node tooling/scripts/run-ledger.mjs block  <id> <reason>   # reason REQUIRED
 *   node tooling/scripts/run-ledger.mjs abandon <id> <reason>
 *   node tooling/scripts/run-ledger.mjs status                 # what a resuming agent reads
 *   node tooling/scripts/run-ledger.mjs open-count             # exit 1 if any row is non-terminal
 *   node tooling/scripts/run-ledger.mjs --self-test
 *
 * Law: docs/ops/FINISH-ONTOLOGY.md - a run is finished when every row is
 * terminal WITH PROOF, never when some PRs were opened.
