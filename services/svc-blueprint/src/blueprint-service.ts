/**
 * svc-blueprint — THE IDENTITY BLUEPRINT (§7.1).
 *
 * The onboarding intelligence is the **Neural Engine**, consumed as an internal
 * service over an HTTP contract (Doctrine §0.7). This service owns the
 * `NeuralEngineClient` interface, the profile it returns, crew matching, mentor
 * shortlists, and the two things §7.2 promises the user: **export** and **hard
 * delete**.
 *
 * ── Three properties this file is built around ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. **No half-written Blueprint.** The engine is called *before* the
 *    transaction opens. If it fails, nothing is written — not a blueprint row
 *    with a null profile, not a crew membership waiting for one. §7.2's failure
 *    path is enforced by ordering, not by cleanup.
 *
 * 2. **Placement is reproducible.** Every input to a placement decision is a
 *    pure function of profiles and crew ids (`matching/crew-matching.ts`). The
 *    only clock in this file writes `ts` columns; none of them is read back by
 *    anything that decides where a person goes.
 *
 * 3. **The profile never leaves except to its owner.** It is not on an event
 *    payload, not on a span, not in an error message, not in a log line. It
 *    goes into `blueprints.profile` and comes back out through `export()` and
 *    the authorised read on the router. §10.
 *
 * ── What this service is not ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It holds no balances and posts no ledger transactions. Nothing in this
 * package imports the ledger client, and nothing should: a crew is a social
 * object, and `crews.xp` is a count.
 *
 * (Said without naming the package, deliberately. The DoD gate classifies a
 * file as a money path by searching for that import specifier, so a comment
 * asserting its absence would classify this file as touching money — and the
 * gate would then pass only via its "some test exists nearby" fallback. A gate
 * that passes by coincidence is not a gate.)

   * Not a soft delete, not a tombstone, not an anonymisation. Five statements in
   * one transaction, and afterwards no row in this schema references the user.
   *
   * Four decisions worth stating, because each is a way this could have quietly
   * failed to cascade:
   *
   *  · **Mentor rows are deleted on BOTH sides.** Deleting only `student_id`
   *    would leave the user on other people's shortlists — their id, their fit
   *    score, still queryable. That is the single easiest half of this to miss.
   *
   *  · **Match runs go with them.** They are keyed by user and describe that
   *    user's placement history. They hold crew ids and integers, never another
   *    person's profile, precisely so that deleting them is complete rather
   *    than partial.
   *
   *  · **A crew emptied by the departure is dissolved.** Otherwise a hard
   *    delete leaves a crew of zero that still appears in matching, still gets
   *    scored, and still carries the name derived from its founder.
   *
   *  · **`profiles.blueprint_id` in svc-identity is cleared by an EVENT.** This
   *    service does not and must not write another service's tables (§2). The
   *    `blueprintDeleted` event is our half of the contract; svc-identity's
   *    consumer is theirs. The test asserts the event is published with the
   *    payload that consumer needs, because that is the boundary we own.
   *
   * Idempotent: erasing an already-erased user deletes nothing, publishes
   * nothing, and returns a receipt of zeroes.
