# Threat model — current (fiat plane · wallet_rpc · vendor Java)

**Board:** D26-P3-02 · **Class:** Judgment (not a pentest, not go-live, not clearance).  
**Tip this page was written against:** `1723273b` (`origin/main` at branch create, 2026-08-15). Re-derive: `git rev-parse --short origin/main`.  
**What this is:** ranked judgment of **custodial money doors** on the Fiat Plane, the vendored **`01_wallet_rpc`** custody tree, and **vendor Java dual-book** risk. Residuals are **named tickets / sockets / gates**, not vibes.  
**What this is not:** an attack campaign, a Strix/ZAP run, a host pentest, or a licence to boot wallet RPC. Track B attack work stays later — [`SECURITY-WHEN-PLAIN.md`](SECURITY-WHEN-PLAIN.md).

**Leverage (Phase A IN):** existing security floor + wallet-rpc review + Java money-plane map + staging-deploy slice. This page is the **current home**. Do not treat [`audit/2026-07-29/05-THREAT-MODEL.md`](audit/2026-07-29/05-THREAT-MODEL.md) as live. Do not treat [`PEACE-OF-MIND-AUDIT-CURRENT.md`](PEACE-OF-MIND-AUDIT-CURRENT.md) as this mountain (orientation / product scoreboard only).

**Sibling slice (kept):** [`THREAT-MODEL-STAGING-DEPLOY.md`](THREAT-MODEL-STAGING-DEPLOY.md) is D26-P3-01 — one workflow file. It is **not** this document.

**Class X stays Nitro human:** secret values and rotation, production go-live, sanctions **list content**. Agents do not generate keys, paste secrets, or fill `INTAFACED_SANCTIONS_REGIONS`.

## 0 · Verdict (one breath)

**The Fiat Plane may hold customer value only in `packages/ledger-client`.** TS money services are doors into that book. The vendored Java exchange still contains a second book that is **neutered in source** (Grade D empty, throws/doors/DAO no-ops) and **unproven at runtime** (compose jars are not the scanned tree). **`01_wallet_rpc` must not be pointed at real value** — owner actions + security review findings still LIVE the moment anyone supplies env and starts it. Staging deploy credentials are a separate, smaller blast radius ([P3-01](THREAT-MODEL-STAGING-DEPLOY.md)).

**Go-live is blocked by named Class X and §13 sockets, not by “we need another July 29 one-pager.”**

## 3 · Fiat plane — custodial money doors

**Law:** no module holds its own balance. Decimal strings on the wire; scaled bigint in memory. Kill path is a separate lever (`OPS-KILL-SWITCH-RUNBOOK.md` · board **D26-P2-10**), not a deploy rollback.

### 3.1 What is a door (and what is not)

A **money door** is a public or S2S entry that can create, hold, settle, reverse, or refuse a ledger recipe. Promise-falsify suites (**D26-P2-01** family) exist so those doors refuse invented rails rather than silently succeeding.

| Door class                         | Where it lives                         | Current judgment                                                                                          | Named residual                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Ledger purpose / freeze / recipes  | `svc-ledger` + `ledger-client`         | SoT. Live-path matrix **D26-P2-11** (#1745). Unmapped live path is a bug.                                 | Recipe queue vs §13 — do not invent recipes         |
| Pay settle / mandate / grant       | `svc-pay`                              | Public doors refuse invent. **Card gateway stays Class X refuse** (tip `#1995`).                          | `socket.psp-partners` (commercial; ADR 2026-08-04)  |
| Pay crypto rail                    | `svc-pay` `EvmLiveChain`               | Ledger-only booking. Production RPC + hot-wallet key = **owner-supplied**.                                | Class X keys/RPC; dust policy product               |
| Bank earn / cards / ramps          | `svc-bank`                             | Refuse invent when rates/issuer unset (**D26-P2-01e**).                                                   | Partner tables / Class X issuer                     |
| P2P escrow / dispute               | `svc-p2p`                              | Escrow in ledger; human ruling.                                                                           | Moderator ids must not be invented                  |
| Trade / matching fill              | `svc-trade` / `svc-matching`           | Fills must not mint outside ledger. Matching dual-target is **D26-P2-06** (not this page).                | No invented mids/depth                              |
| Token stake / buyback              | `svc-token`                            | Crash windows refuse unfunded yield.                                                                      | Product residual on schedules                       |
| Vendor Java HTTP mint/withdraw     | `ucenter-api` / `admin` / `otc-api`    | Dual-book door + throw in **source**. Admin has **no compose service**.                                   | §4 below                                            |
| `01_wallet_rpc` spend              | `vendor/.../01_wallet_rpc`             | **Not in the fleet.** Gates forbid build/boot.                                                            | §5 below                                            |

## 4 · Vendor Java — dual-book risk

**Law:** [`adr/2026-08-02-adopt-vendored-product-keep-our-ledger.md`](adr/2026-08-02-adopt-vendored-product-keep-our-ledger.md) · residual [`adr/2026-08-04-java-dual-book-residual.md`](adr/2026-08-04-java-dual-book-residual.md) (D-S-17).  
**Map (executed):** [`VENDOR-JAVA-MONEY-PLANE-MAP-D26-P2-02.md`](VENDOR-JAVA-MONEY-PLANE-MAP-D26-P2-02.md) · `pnpm map:vendor-java-money-plane`.  
**Rule that must not be laundered:** **no runtime safety claim may cite a source scan as evidence.**

### 4.1 What holds in source (tip)

| Control                         | Strength                         | Ticket / gate                                              |

### 4.2 What does **not** hold

1. **Scanned source ≠ running binary.** Compose jars are gitignored; a clean source scan is a claim about files. Absent rebuilt jars, runtime is **UNVERIFIED** (D26-P2-07 done-bar: path real, not a green safety tick).
2. **HTTP door cannot reach Kafka / cron / Spring events.** `market` settlement and `wallet` `FinanceConsumer` are the load-bearing seams. Withdraw path can hit **RPC send before** the dual-book throw — §13 `socket.vendor-wallet-chain-before-book`. Compose **lacks** a `wallet` service today; mounting it without that control is a custody incident.
3. **Allowlisted second-book writes name ledger recipes; zero are redirected.** §13 `socket.vendor-java-ledger-redirect`. A throw is a holding position, not a migration.
4. **Grade C remaining sites** are door-only on some approve/envelope paths (map). Admin mint controllers are CLOSED in source **and** have no compose service — do not read that as “admin is production-safe.”
5. **Supply-chain of committed jars** (wallet_rpc 18 jars including an unnamed bitcoinj fork; Spring Boot 1.5.9). Board **D26-P3-11** — Maven/vendor in scan scope. Not closed by this judgment.

## 5 · `wallet_rpc` (incl. F10 · owner secrets)

**Review (static, 2026-08-05/06):** [`security/WALLET-RPC-SECURITY-REVIEW-2026-08-05.md`](security/WALLET-RPC-SECURITY-REVIEW-2026-08-05.md). That **is** the adoption-precondition read. It is **not** clearance to deploy.  
**Owner page:** [`OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md`](OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md). **No secret values on this page.**  
**Perimeter gates:** `wallet-rpc-auth-scan` · `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan` (M5–M7: no Dockerfile, no compose, no CI boot) · `secret-scan` withdraw-wallet convention.

**A4 still stands:** do not deploy `01_wallet_rpc` against real value. “Just point it at a testnet” is **not** available (F4 / A3b: no chain id + Etherscan mainnet second broadcast).

### 5.1 Findings that decide custody (rank, not CVSS)

LIVE = live the moment env is supplied and the process starts. Nothing in this tree runs in the fleet today; that is **enforced**, not incidental.

| **F9** | Unencrypted bitcoinj wallet + key-destroy race | Review F9 |
| **F10** | **`act/pom.xml` declares `rpc-common` twice (1.0 then 1.2).** Maven takes **1.0**. Reactor builds **1.2**. Auth guard may be absent on `act`. Gate W1 was version-blind; scan now **names** the 1.0 entries and still cannot prove resolution without Maven. | **D26-P2-09** · `tooling/ci/wallet-rpc-auth-scan.mjs` F10 comments |
| **F19 / A2** | Deleted `main()` still disclosed a second ECT secret in git history | **A2** separate rotation |
| **A3** | ACT node RPC in a test `main()` — likely upstream’s node | Owner decision whether it is ours |

**Spend surfaces (map):** six HTTP `WalletController` send helpers + `@Scheduled` `PaymentHandler` / `CoinCollectJob` (cron **outside** any HTTP interceptor) → §13 `socket.wallet-rpc-spend-perimeter`.

### 5.2 What is already enforced (so this judgment is not a memory test)

- No `WALLET_RPC_AUTH_TOKEN` (≥32) → bootable modules that carry the guard **do not start**.
- ECT refuses unset **and** the old disclosed value (SHA-256 match; value not in tree).
- W3: publishing a wallet_rpc port off `127.0.0.1` in compose fails CI.
- Mainnet constants frozen; no new mainnet selector; M6/M7 forbid compose/CI boot.
- **F10 residual remains:** `act` is the module the gate cannot honestly bless.

**D26-P3-05** (secret rotation **readiness** runbook) is ops engineering adjacent; **performing** rotation stays X.

## 7 · Named residuals (tickets, not vibes)

Ordered by what an attacker gains if we pretend they are closed.

| # | Residual | Kind | Owner |
| - | -------- | ---- | ----- |
| **R1** | Disclosed wallet_rpc secrets still in git history — rotate/sweep **A1** (first) and **A2**; decide **A3** | Class X | Nitro |
| **R2** | **F10** `act` / `rpc-common` 1.0 vs 1.2 — unauthenticated `/rpc/**` if 1.0 wins | **D26-P2-09** + auth-scan version proof | Denon implement (JDK/Maven to prove) |
| **R3** | **F4 / A3b** chain-id-less sign + Etherscan mainnet second broadcast — testnet is not a mitigation | `SPEC-EIP155-…` · **D26-P2-09** | Denon + JDK; not agent-hot-fix without compile |
| **R4** | Java **runtime unverified** (jars ≠ scanned source) + **`socket.vendor-java-ledger-redirect`** (zero redirects) + **`socket.vendor-wallet-chain-before-book`** | **D26-P2-07** path · §13 sockets | Denon; do not mount `wallet` compose |
| **R5** | Fiat live rails: **`socket.psp-partners`**, sanctions **content**, pay production RPC/hot wallet | Class X | Nitro + counsel |
| R6 | Cron/HTTP spend on wallet_rpc if ever composed | `socket.wallet-rpc-spend-perimeter` | Owner before any Dockerfile |
| R7 | Staging environment protection + host (P3-01 D1) | Class X / ops | Nitro — see staging threat model |
| R8 | Auth/session written review | **D26-P3-06** | Judgment mountain (not this PR) |
| R9 | Vendor Java Maven/CVE in scan scope | **D26-P3-11** | Security mountain |
| R10 | Kill-switch completeness on every money route | **D26-P2-10** | Eng |
| R11 | F3/F1/F2 log sinks — if the tree ever runs, logs **are** the exfil channel | Review F1–F3 | Must fix **before** any boot, after A4 |

## 8 · Proven vs reasoned vs out of scope

**Proven on tip (gates / maps / reviews already landed):** dual-book Grade D empty; door registrations 5/5; custody-scan Java walk; wallet-rpc mainnet/auth/secret scans; card gateway Class X refuse; P3-01 workflow static checks; vendor Java money-plane map runner.

**Reasoned, not executed:** every claim about a running wallet_rpc or a rebuilt Java jar on a host. This machine’s threat model does not compile Java or pentest.

**Out of scope here:** Protocol Plane / INTACHAIN implement (Shehzad); Vue craft; D26-P0-05 options ADR; matching engine internals; staging workflow controls (already written).

## 9 · Review triggers (when this page is stale)

Re-read when any of these land — each invalidates a sentence above:

| Event | Invalidates |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `01_wallet_rpc` Dockerfile, compose service, or CI boot | §5 “unenforced absence”; A4 |
| F10 pom fix + Maven-resolved proof | R2 |
| EIP-155 spec applied and compiled | R3; “testnet mitigation” |
| Rebuilt compose jars from scanned source in CI | §4.2 (1) |
| `wallet` Java service added to compose | R4 chain-before-book |
| `socket.psp-partners` filled or card issuer invented | §3 |
| Sanctions list populated | Class X content; geo-IP socket |
| Staging host exists / first deploy | P3-01 becomes empirical |
| D26-P3-06 auth review ships | §3.2 session row |
| A1/A2 rotation confirmed by Nitro | R1 (history still disclosed; values must be worthless) |
