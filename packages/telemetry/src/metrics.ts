/**
 * PROMETHEUS METRICS — the numbers an SLO panel is drawn from (§14.5).
 *
 * ── What was actually missing ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `./start.ts` fixed the TRACE half: it registers a real `NodeTracerProvider`,
 * so the spans every service was already writing now reach Tempo. The METRIC
 * half had no equivalent, and its absence was total rather than partial —
 * verified on this branch before a line was written:
 *
 *   · `prom-client`, `text/plain; version=0.0.4` and `http_request_duration`
 *     appear NOWHERE under `services/` or `packages/`.
 *   · `tooling/infra/prometheus.yaml` scraped `localhost:9090` (itself) and
 *     `nats:8222`. Not one application target.
 *   · `tooling/infra/grafana/` held a datasource provisioning file and nothing
 *     else — no dashboard, and no provider that could have loaded one.
 *
 * So Grafana pointed at a Prometheus that held no application series, and §14's
 * "at least one SLO dashboard panel" had nothing it could have plotted.
 *
 * ── Why this lives in the shared package, not in one service ────────────────
 *
 * §14 says "per module". Nineteen services cannot each invent a metric name and
 * still be one dashboard: `svc-trade` emitting `trade_requests_total` and
 * `svc-pay` emitting `pay_http_total` is nineteen dashboards and no fleet view.
 * The series names, the label set and the bucket boundaries are decided HERE,
 * once, so the panel that works for the edge works for the next adopter with no
 * dashboard change — the new service simply appears as another `service=` value.
 *
 * ── Why no `prom-client` ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It was considered and rejected, not overlooked. `prom-client` is a reasonable
 * library, but the exposition format below is roughly eighty lines, it is
 * frozen (0.0.4), and this repo's supply-chain ratchet (`pnpm scan:deps`) makes
 * every new runtime dependency a standing cost. The deciding argument is that a
 * dependency would not have removed the hard part: the risk here was never
 * "can we format a histogram", it was "does anything scrape it, and does the
 * dashboard name the series we actually emit". A library answers neither, and
 * both are answered by tests in this change. What the format costs us in
 * hand-written code is repaid by `promtool check metrics` — the real Prometheus
 * parser — being run against this module's output; see `metrics.test.ts` and
 * the PR body.
 *
 * ── Not a public surface ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The labels below are route names, status classes and auth outcomes. No user
 * id, no amount, no path an attacker chose. It is still an INTERNAL endpoint:
 * whatever ingress sits in front of a service must not route `/metrics`, the
 * same way it must not route `/admin/*`. That is a deployment property this
 * module cannot enforce and does not pretend to.
