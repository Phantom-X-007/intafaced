# Depth / tape product SLO — honest empty book

**Tracker:** D26-P4-06 · board [`DENON-HARD-PARALLEL-BOARD-2026-08-09.md`](../DENON-HARD-PARALLEL-BOARD-2026-08-09.md) §8  
**Status:** **Accepted — 2026-08-15.** Spec for the shell client. Class **N**.  
**Decision owner:** Denon. **Written by:** Denon agent.  
**Lane:** LIVE-LANES `denon-d26-p4-06-depth-slo`  
**This PR does not edit** `services/svc-trade` (open futures listing PRs) · no Vue craft · no Shehzad chain · no mm-bot seed as live.

## The decision

> **An empty book stays empty.** The product surface may show listed-and-quiet, listed-and-dark, or kill-switched. It may not invent depth, invent a mid, manufacture a cross, or replay seed fills as live tape.

This is a **honesty SLO**, not a latency SLO. No measured depth/tape p50/p99 exists in this repo. **No number is published here.** An unscored feed must not receive a fake grade (same rule as D-S-18 latency grading: a measurement that has not run is **no score**, not a low score).

---

## What this file is for

The vendored shell (`:8090`, Phase A **V-SHELL**) is the sole product UI. Agents must not rebuild it. This spec tells that client — and any later wire — what the existing **public doors already answer**, so the desk cannot “look live” by filling a hole.

**Leverage (Phase A IN):** V-SHELL + `svc-matching` + `svc-ws` + `svc-trade` public REST already on tip. Horizon row `web.terminal` is **IN / NOW / N**. Path is wire-to-existing-doors, not a second book.

## 1 · Public doors (read-only — named by file)

These are the doors the shell may read. This spec does **not** change them.

### Matching — engine book (not the listing)

| Door                                  | File                                                                                             | Honest empty / dark                                                                                                                                                               |

Depth **reads** still go through `existingBook` — do not treat a still-served empty ladder as “the venue is live” if `/ready` is 503. |

Contract text: [`services/svc-matching/README.md`](../../services/svc-matching/README.md) (depth is public because a price is not a secret).

Edge does **not** proxy matching. Halt new risk via the **trade** module, not a fake `/api/matching` path — [`services/svc-edge/src/routes.ts`](../../services/svc-edge/src/routes.ts).

### Trade — CCXT public REST (listing + tape)

Do **not** edit this service in the D26-P4-06 ship. Named so the shell knows which contract it is already on:

Listing union: `TRADE_URL` `GET /api/v1/markets` is authority; matching `GET /markets` is unioned. Engine unreachable → listed markets stay subscribable **without a fabricated book**. Both unreachable → keep last known list; never report zero markets. Law: [`docs/adr/2026-08-04-market-id-authority.md`](../adr/2026-08-04-market-id-authority.md). WS later tightened “empty ≠ zero” on the **socket** (404 / no snapshot) so a client cannot treat absence as a priced empty ladder.

## 3 · Forbidden (product)

1. **Manufactured crosses** — house/seed must not take its own other side to print a last. D26-P1-T10: [`services/svc-trade/src/mm/seed-honesty.ts`](../../services/svc-trade/src/mm/seed-honesty.ts) (read-only here).
2. **Seed fills as live** — public tape / OHLCV / “last” / volume windows exclude seeded prints (SD-3). A seed job is ops liquidity, not organic flow.
3. **Invent mid** — empty book, empty venue, unmapped id, desynced stream, dark OTC feed → **null**. Never last-print-as-mid, never `(bid+ask)/2` on missing sides, never env map after the live source said no.
4. **Empty-as-healthy when the hop is down** — 502/503/throw stay 502/503/throw.
5. **Latency theater** — no invented p99, “sub-100ms desk”, or Connect-style letter grade for a feed that has not been measured.

Internal market-making on **our** book stays blocked (D26-P0-01 Q1). `trade.mm-bot` may seed when ops enable it; that seed is still not live tape and is not a mark input.

## 4 · SLO statement (honesty)

| Claim                                                    | Status                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Empty book / no tape is distinguishable from engine-down | **In force** on the doors in §1.                                                                                                       |
| Seed volume is not user volume                           | **In force** (T10 / SD-3).                                                                                                             |
| Mid never invented                                       | **In force** (venue mark, OTC, MM seed mid, D-S-18 capture hole ≠ quiet market).                                                       |
| Depth/tape **latency** SLO (p50/p99, staleness budget)   | **Does not exist.** No dashboard, no probe, no published number. Refuse to invent one. Residual: measure later, then write the number. |

D-S-18 ([`docs/adr/2026-08-04-predict-quant-connect-law.md`](../adr/2026-08-04-predict-quant-connect-law.md)): a venue that is not connected is **absent in the record, never an empty book**. Same shape: a hole in capture or a dark socket is a hole, not a quiet market.

## 5 · Leftover (not this spec)

- Vue / shell **craft** — HUMAN lane `nitro-frontend-all`. This file is the contract; it is not a UI PR.
- `services/svc-trade` code — open futures listing PRs; do not dual-edit.
- Measured latency SLO — none; do not fake it.
- Internal house MM on our venue — blocked until a later owner ruling.
- D26-P4-05 private positions payload freeze — sibling, not this mountain.
- Edge kill-switch does not halt the browser’s direct `svc-ws` socket — named SOCKET, not closed here.

## Done bar

1. Named the existing trade/matching/ws public doors by file (read-only).
2. Named what the platform may show when empty / dark / kill-switched.
3. Named the three forbids: manufactured crosses, seed fills as live, invent mid.
4. Stated that the SLO is honesty, and that **no measured latency SLO exists**.
