 * Mid from venue public book (top bid/ask). Missing symbol / empty book / error → null.
 *
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS MID WAS THE THIRD SIZE-BLIND ONE, AND THE ONLY ONE WITH NO GATE AFTER IT
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This function read `snap.bids[0][0]` and `snap.asks[0][0]` — the PRICE at each
 * best level — and discarded `[1]`, the QUANTITY, and `snap.observedAt` with it.
 * It is the same pair of discards already fixed in `futures/mark-from-depth.ts`
 * (`bestFromDepth`, size, c7dfb5e4), `futures/mark-from-venue.ts`
 * (`bestFromVenueBook`, size, cc90c2f4) and again on that file for age (#1163).
 *
 * WHAT MADE THIS COPY THE WORST OF THE THREE. Both fixed paths hand their mid to
 * a `QuotedMarkSource`, so a bad answer still met `mark-policy.ts` downstream.
 * `MmMidSource` returns a bare `string | null`. `mm/seed-jobs.ts:141` checks it
 * for null and blank and nothing else; `mm/seed-market.ts` hands it to
 * `planSeedQuotes`, which validates the DECIMAL and never asks where it came
 * from. There is no `MarkQuality`, no `asOf`, no staleness limit and no notional
 * floor anywhere on this path. Whatever this function returned was posted.
 *
 * ── HOW A BOOK THE FUTURES PATH REFUSED CAME BACK AS OUR OWN PRICE ────────────
 *
 * `index.ts` builds this source from `venuePublicAdapter` and
 * `parseVenueMarkSymbols(env.TRADE_VENUE_MARK_SYMBOLS)` — the SAME adapter
 * instance and the SAME symbol map that `createConfiguredVenueMarkSource` reads
 * for futures marks. So the two paths read one external book through one mapping,
 * and the interesting case is the one where they disagree:
 *
 *   1. the venue's book goes to dust, or stops updating, on a mapped symbol;
 *   2. the futures venue mark REFUSES it — that is exactly what cc90c2f4 and
 *      #1163 built — and `markSourcePrefer` falls through to matching depth;
 *   3. matching depth is OUR book, and this MM seeded that book off the very
 *      snapshot step 2 refused;
 *   4. `bestFromDepth`'s size requirement then measures the MM's OWN
 *      `TRADE_MM_SEED_QTY`, which is ops-chosen, and `markSourceFromDepth` stamps
 *      the depth read as the observation — so the age is zero by construction no
 *      matter how old the venue book was.
 *
 * The dust and the staleness are laundered: refused as somebody else's quote,
 * accepted as ours. Step 4 is not a hole in `bestFromDepth` — every requirement it
 * carries, the absolute floor and the size-relative one added after an absolute
 * floor was measured paying out 190,000 USDT, asks a question about SIZE: is there
 * enough resting here to stand behind this payout. On our own seeded book there
 * is. None of them can ask about PROVENANCE — "was this price copied from a book
 * nobody checked" — because by then the venue snapshot is gone and only its number
 * survives. Only this function still has the snapshot, which is why the check is
 * here and not there. A stronger size rule downstream does not substitute for it,
 * and would not have caught this.
 *
 * HONEST ABOUT THE ONE LINK THAT NEEDS OPS. Step 3 requires
 * `TRADE_MM_SEED_MARKETS` to name a market whose depth futures marks read.
 * `seed-market.ts` submits straight to `matching.submit` and never passes
 * `assertTradable`, so nothing in code stops that; it is a configuration away,
 * not an exploit, and seeding a freshly-listed market is the feature's purpose.
 * The chain is therefore reachable-by-configuration rather than live on today's
 * defaults, and it is stated that way rather than overclaimed.
 *
 * ── THE LAW, WHICH LANDED THE DAY THIS WAS WRITTEN ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `docs/adr/2026-08-08-house-desk-and-market-making-fairness.md` rule 1,
 * Accepted: *"Internal quotes may seed liquidity. They may never become a mark."*
 * Its own safety argument is that *"if the internal MM is the only resting size,
 * the book is not payout-grade and the mark refuses — exactly as it does today
 * for a dust book."* That argument holds on SIZE and says nothing about
 * PROVENANCE: an MM resting genuine size at a price copied from a dust or stale
 * external book produces a payout-grade book carrying an unchecked price. Rule 1
 * gets broken without anyone deciding to break it. Refusing here is what keeps
 * the rule true.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS REUSED, AND NOTHING IS INVENTED ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `midFromVenueBook` is imported from `mark-from-venue.ts`, which is where the
 * size-aware mid over this exact snapshot shape already lives; through it this
 * path gets `bestLevelIsQuotable` and `DEFAULT_MIN_BEST_LEVEL_NOTIONAL` from
 * `mark-from-depth.ts`. The requirement is built with that file's own
 * `depthRequirement`, so when its two halves changed shape under this branch this
 * path had one call to adapt and no rule to re-decide — which is the whole point
 * of importing it. `readObservedAt` comes from `mark-from-venue.ts` too. The age
 * bar is `acceptableForMarking` under `DEFAULT_FUTURES_MARK_POLICY`.
 *
 * There is NO new constant, no new policy shape and no new name here on purpose:
 * `DEFAULT_MIN_BEST_LEVEL_NOTIONAL` is awaiting an owner ruling, and a second
 * number would be a second unruled thing to rule.
 *
 * `acceptableForMarking` is the WEAKER of the two gates, for the reason
 * `markSourcePrefer` gives: this port does not know its caller's bar, so it must
 * not apply one. If the owner wants the 60-second liquidation bar on seed mids,
 * `policy` already carries it and no call site moves.
 *
 * REFUSING IS RETURNING NULL, which this function already did for a missing
 * symbol and an empty book, and which `seed-jobs.ts` already handles by skipping
 * the market (`skipped: 'missing_mid'`). No new refusal vocabulary, no new
 * branch downstream, and nothing anywhere turns a null mid into a number — the
 * one honest answer was already in this function's vocabulary.
