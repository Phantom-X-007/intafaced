/**
 * SESSION KEYS — scoped, expiring, non-custodial delegation (§17.4, §19).
 *
 * A session key is what lets an agent trade on a user's behalf under guardrails
 * without ever being able to move the user's funds out of the account. The
 * scope is not advisory: every field below is checked on-chain, on every call,
 * by SmartAccount.
 *
 * Doctrine §16.10 — "no contract grants platform keys withdrawal power over
 * user funds". A session key is the only thing the platform ever holds on this
 * plane, so the shape of a session key IS the custody boundary. Four properties
 * make it safe:
 *
 *   1. EXPIRY IS MANDATORY. `validUntil` must be in the future and no more than
 *      MAX_SESSION_DURATION away. There is no such thing as a permanent grant.
 *   2. TARGETS ARE AN EXACT ALLOWLIST, and can never include the account
 *      itself — so a session key can never grant itself more power, rotate the
 *      owner, or mint another session.
 *   3. SELECTORS ARE AN EXACT ALLOWLIST, and every selector that transfers a
 *      token or hands out an allowance is refused AT GRANT TIME. A session key
 *      with outbound-transfer power cannot be constructed. Not "is not issued" —
 *      cannot be constructed: `assertGrantable` reverts.
 *   4. NATIVE VALUE IS CAPPED cumulatively by `spendLimitWei`, counted before
 *      the external call, so re-entrancy cannot spend it twice.
 *
 * The user grants it. The user revokes it. The platform relays the transaction
 * and holds nothing else.
