/**
 * ENGINE ↔ COUNTERPART RECONCILE.
 *
 * ── The bug this exists for ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The engine's state and the order/ledger state have independent lifecycles and
 * nothing compared them. The engine's books live in memory, rebuilt at boot by
 * replaying `engine_journal.ndjson`; svc-trade's `trade.orders` and the ledger's
 * hold accounts live in Postgres. Reset one, and the other does not notice.
 *
 * Measured on the dev fleet on 2026-08-03, with everything green:
 *
 *   · engine `GET /markets` → 10 market ids, 26 journal records
 *   · `trade.markets`       → 16 markets, and **not one of the engine's 10 is
 *                             among them** — the intersection is empty
 *   · `trade.orders`        → 0 rows
 *   · `ledger.accounts`     → 17 live `order:<id>` hold accounts, every one of
 *                             them naming an order id that appears in the
 *                             journal and in no `trade.orders` row
 *
 * Nothing was stranded, because all 17 balances happened to be zero. That is
 * luck, not a property. Flip one of those balances positive and the value is
 * unreachable: it belongs to an order svc-trade cannot find, so no cancel path
 * will ever release it, and `reconcileOrder` — which starts by looking the
 * order up — returns `not_found` and stops.
 *
 * ── Why the answer is a report and not a repair ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every disagreement below could be "fixed" by picking a side. None of them
 * should be. The engine holding an order the caller has never heard of and the
 * caller holding funds for an order the engine has never heard of are the same
 * observation from two ends, and which one is *wrong* is not derivable from the
 * two states — it depends on which write was lost, and a lost fill looks
 * exactly like an order that was never live.
 *
 * So this classifies and refuses. It writes nothing, cancels nothing, and moves
 * no value; §0.6 value movement is a ledger recipe and recipes are an owner
 * carve-out. What it produces is a finding that names the order and **both**
 * states, which is the thing an operator needs and did not have.
 *
 * ── Purity ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The counterpart's view arrives as an argument. This service opens no database
 * (`env.ts`: "there is no `DATABASE_URL`"), reads no other schema (§2), and
 * learns nothing about assets, users or holds — `funded` is a boolean the
 * caller asserts and this file only relays. The engine stays a thing that
 * speaks in account ids and quantities.
 */

/**
 * What the caller believes about one order.
 *
 * `state` is deliberately three values and not svc-trade's status enum: mapping
 * `filled | cancelled | rejected | expired` down to `terminal` is the caller's
 * job, and doing it here would teach the engine an enum that belongs to another
 * service.
