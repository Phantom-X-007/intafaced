/**
 * ACCOUNT STATE, READ FROM THE SERVICE THAT OWNS IT (§8.2 "account-state
 * grounded").
 *
 * A support desk needs to know whether an account is frozen and how far it is
 * verified. There are exactly two ways to arrange that, and only one of them is
 * allowed here:
 *
 *   · Copy it. Subscribe to identity events, keep a `support.accounts` table,
 *     render from that. Fast, and wrong: the moment the desk holds its own copy
 *     of account status, an operator can freeze-check against a projection that
 *     is minutes stale and tell a user their account is fine while compliance
 *     has already locked it. That is a second book for a non-money fact, and it
 *     fails the same way the money one does.
 *   · Read it, per request, from svc-identity, and record WHEN you read it.
 *
 * This is the second. It follows the read-port convention already used by
 * `svc-trade/src/spot/rank-perks.ts` and `svc-academy/src/stake-source.ts`:
 * the consumer declares the interface it needs, a null implementation covers
 * tests and a dev stack running without the dependency, and production injects
 * an HTTP client validated against the published contract.
 *
 * FAILING CLOSED HERE MEANS SAYING "I DID NOT READ IT", NOT THROWING THE USER
 * OUT. That is the one place this diverges from `rank-perks`, on purpose:
 * rank-perks refuses the order, because mispricing a fee is worse than not
 * placing a trade. Here the operator is mid-conversation with a person who
 * already has a problem, and refusing to let them escalate because a service
 * they cannot see is down would strand that person. So a dark plane produces a
 * case file that SAYS the account was never read (`grounding.status: 'unread'`,
 * `reason: 'plane_dark'`) — degraded and honest about it, rather than either
 * silently blank or hard-refused.

 * S2S-authenticated with the shared internal secret — the same control as
 * `/internal/rank/:userId/perks`, and for the same reason: the tRPC surface
 * that exposes account facts is a `scopedProcedure` needing a USER principal,
 * and svc-support is calling on behalf of an operator who is not the account
 * holder. Forwarding the operator's principal would either fail authorization
 * or, worse, require identity to accept "trust me, this is a support person",
 * which is an authority no scope grants.
 *
 * Every failure — transport, 401, 404, unparseable body — becomes `null`, which
 * the caller renders as an explicitly unread grounding. A shape that does not
 * match the published contract is a shape we must not guess at.
