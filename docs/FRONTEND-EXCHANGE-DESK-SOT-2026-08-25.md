# Exchange trader desk — source of truth

**[HISTORY 2026-09-01]** Honesty/kit facts may still be true; **not** the live execution map. Live: [`FRONTEND-REMAINING-SOT-2026-08-25.md`](FRONTEND-REMAINING-SOT-2026-08-25.md) §§9–21. Chart: Advanced Charts pending, LWC interim (`LICENCE-POSITION.md` §1.1a). Do not treat LWC 3.8 or “never TradingView” lines below as current.

**Status:** N4 **paint** landed (#3301) · **desk look FAILED** · **this file = kit / honesty / leverage facts only** · craft bar = [`FRONTEND-EXCHANGE-DESK-LAYOUT-SOT-2026-08-25.md`](FRONTEND-EXCHANGE-DESK-LAYOUT-SOT-2026-08-25.md) (final audit §16 2026-08-25)  
**Date:** 2026-08-25  
**Tip at audit:** `origin/main` `f7fbf77bb` **[RAN-IT]** — includes `#3281` 390, `#3301` N4, `#3280` FOK merged, `#3306`. Door is diverged; do not treat door `Exchange.vue` as tip inventory.  
**Live page this session:** Orca tab `http://127.0.0.1:8090/exchange/btc_usdt` is the Grok **door**, not tip. Codex boots from a **new** `pnpm wt`.  
**Do not use this file as the Codex craft bar.** Layout SoT + `SHOW-LAYOUT.html` win. This file still wins for kit, honesty, and “what not to rebuild.”

## 1 · Verdict

**#3301 did the wrong job.** It remapped orange → gray and squared corners. The page is still the vendored Bizzan desk: marketing nav, overlapping menus, empty chart, ticket as a policy essay, broken white tab chips. Nitro is right. Proof: worktree `.artifacts/uiproof/n4-1440.png` / `n4-390.png`.

**The idiot move:** we asked him to pick N1–N4 off four _identical_ mini-desks. He picked **dense terminal**. We encoded **a skin**. Codex shipped the skin.

**Still true:** Bazaar `:8090` is the product. LWC v3.8 is the chart. Ledger is the book. No new SPA. N4 _paint_ (near-black, no orange, no glass) can stay.

**The real bar:** `/exchange` at 1440 must read as a pro venue in ~2s — Hyperliquid/OKX _jobs_ (chart dominates, book+ticket tight, marketing chrome gone on this route). Honesty stays; it must be _quiet_ (one line), not a wall of refuse copy.

Do not start a second website. Do not pick another palette. Next craft is **layout / IA / chrome-kill on Exchange.vue**, then the chart pane as a tool.

## 2 · What the desk is

The product UI is the vendored Bazaar trader shell:

`vendor/upstream-exchange/05_Web_Front` on **:8090**  
Route: `/exchange` and `/exchange/:pair` (`src/config/routes.js`)  
Page: `src/pages/exchange/Exchange.vue` (~7.3k lines on tip) **[RAN-IT]**

`apps/web` is deleted. Do not resurrect it.

What a pro must see (all already exist as surfaces — craft them, do not replace them):

## 3 · Leverage table

Default path = **IN** (`web.terminal` Phase B). Tracker row `web.terminal` is **done** for wiring (2026-08-22 note) **[RAN-IT `tooling/tracker/features.mjs`]**. Done ≠ pro look. Peace audit: do not launder tracker-green into “venue finished.”

| **Look system**        | **N4 Terminal Zero — LOCKED 2026-08-25 (Nitro, this chat).** Density pole: almost monochrome, chrome-minimal, 1px hairlines, no glass. Draft: `FRONTEND-STYLEBOARD-DRAFT-N1-N4-2026-07-31.md`. Board: `docs/styleboard/SHOW-LAYOUT.html` (`SHOW-NOW.html` is **absent**).

| **N4 tokens (target)** | bg `#000` · panel near-black · text `#c8c8c8` · 1px borders · control fill `#c8c8c8` on black · **no orange accent** · **no glass**. Market up `#0ecb81` / down `#f6465d` unchanged (trader meaning). Methodology’s “avoid pure `#000`” yields to this pick; Codex keeps **readable** contrast on small type (do not silently restyle to N2). |

One kit: **iView 3** + CSS tokens. Design Bar still scores polish. Its “P21 teal now” line is **stale** (see §6).

## 5 · Honesty law (never on the desk)

From methodology + A1 vocabulary + live kline.js comments **[DOC + RAN-IT]**:

- No fake mids, depth, candles, fills, balances, volume.
- Failed fetch ≠ empty list ≠ `$0.00` ≠ “blank market.”
- Chart: `ok` / `empty` / `failed` are three facts. Gaps in series are real gaps, never a zero print.
- Last/24h are **REST snapshots**. Do not imply they are the live depth stream.
- Green/red = **market direction only.** Accent ≠ PnL.
- Dual-book: venue wallet vs platform ledger must be labeled. Unauth blotter already says sign-in for **ledger** balance.
- Auth fixture never seeds money.
- Oracle index on perps strip is `—` until a real source exists. Leave it.
- Owner blanks (fees, leverage, jurisdictions, settlement) stay refuse-closed.

## 7 · Next craft (not this file)

Paint slice **shipped and failed the glance test.** Next = **layout** L0–L7 in [`FRONTEND-EXCHANGE-DESK-LAYOUT-SOT-2026-08-25.md`](FRONTEND-EXCHANGE-DESK-LAYOUT-SOT-2026-08-25.md).

Paste [`PROMPT-CODEX-EXCHANGE-DESK-LAYOUT-2026-08-25.md`](PROMPT-CODEX-EXCHANGE-DESK-LAYOUT-2026-08-25.md) into a **new** worktree off current `origin/main`. Copy the SoT pack first (untracked on the door).

**Not:** another remap, TradingView, new SPA, inventing candles, restyling login/CMS.

---

## 8 · Out of scope (this pack)

Admin · academy · new SPA · TradingView product · graphify as the work · Denon matching/trade **engines** and open `svc-trade` files · Shehzad chain (`#2473`) · 29-domain pro-exchange paper / PX-S01–16 completeness · wallet RPC mainnet · mobile native · Wave C panes

---

## 9 · Unspoken needs locked (overrule in this file if wrong)

1. Ambition of the spec ships. No silent downgrade to “cleaner vendor skin.”
2. “Use the internet” = adopt Bazaar / named Phase A–B adapter — not a new SPA, not a TV clone, not npm a new exchange.
3. Green/red = market only. No fake prices, books, candles, balances.
4. Product UI = Bazaar on :8090. `apps/web` stays dead.
5. Money book = `ledger-client` + `svc-ledger` only.
6. Chart in-shell = lightweight-charts unless proved unable (then stop).
7. He watches the live desk in Orca. Design Mode = he points; builder paints. This spec chat does not steal that.
8. Codex (not this chat) does frontend craft after the pack is the bar.
9. Denon owns invent-risk trade engines; path-intersect open files. Shehzad = chain. Class X = Nitro human.
10. Files are state. Rulings this session land here.
11. Peace objects: keep / stale / first slice / what Codex must not invent — this file.
12. He ends sessions abruptly. This file is the handover.

---

## 10 · Flip conditions

This pack is wrong if any of these become true:

- Nitro overrules N4 (picks N1/N2/N3 or keep-orange) — look law updates **this file** the same turn.
- LWC 3.8 is proved unable to host the required chart job — stop; do not silently swap.
- Tip replaces `05_Web_Front` as product UI (forbidden unless a new ADR).
- `#3280` or another writer owns `Exchange.vue` chart/ticket in a way that a second writer would dual-edit — wait or take CSS-only in `intafaced.css` `.ix-chart-*`.
- Live desk on a **tip** worktree already has a dense pro chart pane (re-screenshot; this session’s door page is not proof of tip).

## 12 · Door (operators, not Nitro)

Grok door `/Users/Nitro/projects/Sovereign` **diverged** vs `origin/main` this session (`sync-door-to-tip.sh` → `DIVERGED`). Do not rebase in the dark. Product work stays in `pnpm wt`. Do not commit this pack on `main`.
