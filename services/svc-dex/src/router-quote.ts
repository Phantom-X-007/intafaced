/**
 * THE SMART ORDER ROUTER (§8.6).
 *
 * Ranks observed quotes (internal book vs pool). Ranking is not a certified
 * best-execution claim — see `refuseBestExClaim` / quote-door `bestEx`.
 *
 * Two venues can fill the same order and they are not comparable at face value.
 * An AMM quote already includes its price impact but pays gas; a book quote is
 * exact at the top and worse as you consume depth. Comparing headline prices
 * picks the wrong venue routinely.
 *
 * So this module compares **effective price** — what the taker actually ends up
 * with, after impact, fees and gas. That is the only comparison that means
 * anything to the person trading.
 *
 * ── Why this file holds no I/O ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Routing is arithmetic over quotes. Keeping it pure means the decision is
 * unit-testable against constructed books and pools, with no chain and no
 * engine, and it means the same code decides identically in a test and in
 * production. Fetching quotes is the caller's job.
 *
 * ── Custody ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing here moves value. svc-dex is a Protocol Plane service: it may read,
 * quote and route, and it must never post to the ledger — `custody-scan`
 * (Doctrine §16.10) fails the build if this service imports a write recipe.
 * That check is what makes "non-custodial" a property rather than a claim, and
 * it is the reason the DEX ships permissionless (§585).
