/**
 * USER MONEY IN AND OUT — the two paths whose absence made the platform
 * unusable end to end.
 *
 * Before this: `recipes.deposit` was called from tests only, so nothing ever
 * credited a user's `available` balance and `orderHold` could only fail; and
 * `withdrawHold/Settle/Reverse` were used in exactly one production site, a
 * MERCHANT payout, so a user could not get money out at all.
 *
 * WHAT EACH TEST HERE IS FOR. Every one of them fails if a specific money path
 * breaks — not if the code is merely rearranged. In particular the questions
 * this file exists to answer are the §5 ones: *if this crashes exactly here,
 * whose funds are stranded?* Each crash point is simulated by driving the two
 * phases separately and asserting what the BOOK says in between, because the
 * book is the only thing that matters when a process dies.
 *
 * Postgres is real: the unique indexes on `(rail, rail_ref)` and
 * `(user_id, client_ref)` are the idempotency, and an in-memory fake would
 * quietly not have them. The ledger is `MemoryLedger`, the reference
 * implementation the conformance suite proves equivalent to svc-ledger's
 * Postgres engine (§4.4).
 *
 * H8a PG-hard: this file never `describe.skip` / `postgresAvailable`. CI uses
 * TEST_DATABASE_URL (per-run database via `createTestDatabase` so schema-qualified
 * `pay.*` SQL stays on `pay`). Local without that env starts Testcontainers
 * `postgres:16-alpine`. Docker/PG down is a failed suite, not a green skip.
 * The admin URL is `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, not `TEST_DATABASE_URL_PAY`: creating a
 * database needs CREATEDB, which the per-service roles deliberately lack.
 */

/**
 * A PER-RUN DATABASE, created and dropped by this suite.
 *
 * This suite APPLIES MIGRATIONS and TRUNCATES TABLES. Pointed at the shared
 * `intafaced` database it did both to the schema and the rows every other
 * worktree and the running docker stack were using — which is how a branch
 * broke `main`'s tests from a different checkout, with live rows in
 * `pay.deposits` / `pay.withdrawals`. #211 moved it to `intafaced_test`, which
 * fixed that and left a smaller version of it: `intafaced_test` is shared too,
 * so two worktrees running THIS FILE still truncated each other.
 *
 * pay's SQL is schema-qualified (`pay.…`) on purpose — §2 keeps a service
 * physically unable to reach outside its own schema. That is exactly why
 * `createTestDb`'s generated schema (`test_pay_4711_1`) cannot host it, the way
 * it hosts svc-ledger. `createTestDatabase` moves the isolation boundary from
 * the schema to the DATABASE and creates `pay` under its real name inside it.
 * Every statement below, and every migration, is unchanged.
 *
 * The URL is the ADMIN one (`TEST_DATABASE_URL`), not `TEST_DATABASE_URL_PAY`:
 * creating a database needs CREATEDB, which the per-service roles deliberately
 * lack. It must still name a `*_test` database — `assertTestDatabase` refuses
 * anything else, and asks the server rather than trusting the string.

 * avoided taking ACCESS EXCLUSIVE locks on tables `payment-service.test.ts` was
 * truncating in a parallel vitest worker. That contortion — and the advisory
 * lock that went with it — existed only because both suites brought the schema
 * up on ONE shared database.
 *

  /**

   * Everything above drives a retry SEQUENTIALLY — call, await, call again. That
   * is the impatient-user case and the job-that-woke-up case, and it is covered.
   * It is not the case a real client produces: a request times out at the edge
   * while it is still running, the client retries, and now two requests are
   * inside this service at once carrying the same business key.
   *
   * The sequential tests cannot see that. `claimWithdrawal` takes `FOR UPDATE`
   * and then RETURNS — the row lock dies with the claim transaction, so both
   * requests get past the claim and both proceed to hold, rail and settle. What
   * makes that safe is not the unique index alone (both callers find the same
   * row) but the layered idempotency underneath it: the ledger keys on
   * `withdraw.*:<id>:<attempt>` and the rail keys on the same string.
   *
   * These tests exist because that is currently an ARGUMENT, and an argument
   * about whether a user can be debited twice should be a passing test instead.
