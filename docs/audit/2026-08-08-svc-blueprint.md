# svc-blueprint — promise audit 2026-08-08 (REPORT ONLY — the service is owner-locked)

Tip: `ff6b50c2`
Auditor: Claude session — lane C
Claim gate:

```
✖ services/svc-blueprint — owner @shehzad002 (blueprint.attestations)
```

Owner-locked, so nothing here was changed. Reading and reporting are explicitly
still allowed; implementing is not.

This is a **partial** audit and says so up front. The claim gate was discovered
partway through the session (see `2026-08-08-svc-bank.md` for why the lane brief
believed otherwise), and with no fix possible the effort went to the promises
whose failure would cost the most: the privacy claims, the "no failure may
produce a URL" claim, and the guards nothing executes.

## Broken, fixed here

None. Nothing was fixed — the service is owner-locked.

## Broken, parked

None found in the promises reached. That is a real result for those eight, and
**not** a clean bill of health for the service: thirteen promises were not
attacked at all.

## Could NOT break, having tried

- **A card failure fabricating a URL.** Walked every exit of `HttpCardRenderer`
  looking for a path that returns a URL or throws past the caller. Timeout,
  transport error, non-2xx, unparseable body, contract mismatch and zero bytes
  all land on the `unavailable` arm. The claim in the README is the strongest
  sentence in the service and it holds.
- **Smuggling session input into the profile column.** The named PII keys are
  refused by a database CHECK, so a future caller that forgets the TypeScript
  path still cannot land the row.
- **Introducing a money column by stealth.** The schema guard is executed on
  every run and would fail the build on the first `numeric`.

## Not reached — named so silence is not read as coverage

Thirteen promises, listed by name because they are the next session's work if the
owner frees the path:

- "A user who re-runs matching must land in the **same crew**" — determinism of
  `crew-matching`, including whether the candidate-set bound is itself
  deterministic (the README says it must be `ORDER BY` + `LIMIT`, "never a
  sample"). **Not verified.**
- "The mentor heuristic is deliberately different … there is a test that fails if
  someone simplifies it that way" — the test's existence was not confirmed.
- "five concurrent joins against two seats" — the placement transaction that must
  not overfill a crew. Not attacked.
- "**The profile is never logged, never traced, never put on an event.**
  `BlueprintSpanAttributes` is a closed type" — not audited.
- "An export lists crewmates by id and role, never by profile" — not audited.
- "`card_asset_url` is written **only** on a real render, **only** for the
  portrait, and **only** by `card` — never by `export`" — not traced.
- Erasure: "erasing a user who never onboarded, erasing twice, and onboarding
  again after erasure" — the transaction boundary the README calls the second
  most bug-prone place in the service. Not attacked.
- Readiness reporting the engine but not gating on the card renderer — not
  exercised.
- "Every procedure operates on `ctx.principal.userId` and never on an id from the
  input" — spot-read, not swept.
- The four remaining CHECK constraints and the two unique indexes.

## What only an owner can decide

`services/svc-blueprint` is claimed by **@shehzad002** under
`blueprint.attestations`. An agent may not implement here. The unlock is the
owner commenting `agents free on services/svc-blueprint`, or a PR moving the
`owner` field in `tooling/tracker/features.mjs`.
