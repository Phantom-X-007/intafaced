# Board Clear — Unspoken Needs (inferred)

**Binding inference for agents.** Nitro does not restate these. If you optimize against them, you fail even if CI is green.

## 1. Outcome he is buying

| He says                   | He means                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Finish everything         | The **product table** flips to Done/Cut — not more “partial residual”                                   |
| Autonomous                | He says **go once**; never “continue?”, never git homework, never tech multi-choice                     |
| No compromise like before | Do not re-optimize for “honest leftover forever”                                                        |
| All out                   | Max parallel force, research depth, PR volume, quality bar — inside doctrine walls                      |
| Compaction-safe           | After context death, cold agent resumes from docs with **zero quality drop**                            |
| Not in the loop           | Physical impossibility (no machine, no keys at all) → sandbox/§13 and **keep going**; never wait on him |

---

## 2. Emotional / operational load he is removing

1. **Confusion about which chat is which** → one campaign home, one scoreboard
2. **Fear that agents drift** → constitution Done bars + ownership map + review loop
3. **Fear that “partial” is celebrated** → scoreboard only celebrates Done/Cut
4. **Fatigue of re-prompting** → forever loop; session end without next ship written = **bug**
5. **Distrust after residual** → explicit supersession of residual-only mode

---

## 3. What “right” means (priority order)

1. **Doctrine-true money** (ledger recipes, no invent, no stranded funds)
2. **Board row Done bar met** (constitution §3) with proof
3. **Tracker honesty** same turn
4. **Parallel progress** without collisions
5. **Speed** — never by skipping 1–3

If 1 and 2 conflict with speed: **slow down, still finish.**  
If 2 conflicts with invent: **Cut+§13, never invent.**

---

## 4. What “going all out” is not

- Not inventing depth/mid/rates/candles/card captures
- Not marking audit Done without audit **package** + deploy proof
- Not asking Denon mid-flight for permission to ship residual
- Not infinite research packs with zero PR
- Not one mega-PR that never merges

---

## 5. Hidden requirements agents must satisfy

| Need                    | Implementation                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always know next action | `BOARD-CLEAR-NEXT.md` updated every turn                      |
| Survive compact         | Constitution + plan + scoreboard + next + process loops       |
| Research before build   | Loop R1 mandatory per ship                                    |
| Spec before code        | Loop S1 — Done-linked acceptance in PR body                   |
| Review after ship       | Loop V1 — adversarial self-check before merge claim           |
| Replan when stuck       | Loop P1 — update execution plan, don’t thrash                 |
| Don’t stop              | Outer loop until scoreboard complete; “continue” is automatic |
| Parallel                | One program per worktree; coordinator owns merge order        |
| Quality                 | Elite bar; Class M self-audit; CI green                       |
| Visible progress        | Merge waves; scoreboard flips                                 |

## 6. Failure modes of the previous campaign (do not repeat)

1. Optimized for residual honesty → **never finished rows**
2. Waited for human “continue”
3. Spec lived in chat → **compaction killed mandate**
4. No mandatory research→spec→build→review loop
5. “Shipped code” confused with “board Done”
6. #289 / card / protocol left as someone else’s problem

---

## 7. Green light meaning

**Green light for “say go”** = process + docs + loops are sufficient that a competent orchestrator, without Nitro, will drive until scoreboard complete under constitution.

**Not** green light that the product is already Done.  
**Not** guarantee against missing prod secrets — those become sandbox Done + §13 without stopping.

If docs claim green light but NEXT is empty or scoreboard stale: **red — fix before go.**
