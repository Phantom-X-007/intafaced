/**
 * THE FAN-OUT (§5.2 ws.gateway).
 *
 * One book per subscribed market, one snapshot per connection, one delta per
 * sequence advance, to everyone watching. No I/O of its own beyond the
 * `DepthSource` port and no timer — the caller drives the clock, so every
 * behaviour below is reachable from a test without waiting for one.
 *
 * ── The contract this must not break ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The wire format is `DepthMessage` from `@intafaced/market-data`, unchanged and
 * not extended. Deltas are computed by `diffDepth`, which the browser's
 * `applyDelta` is the exact inverse of, and both come from the same package —
 * so a client that misses a frame does not have to be told, it can tell. A
 * delta whose `fromSequence` does not match the book it lands on is REFUSED by
 * the client and it resnapshots. Every drop policy below leans on that, which
 * is why none of them is allowed to renumber anything.
 *
 * ── Backpressure: degrade, then disconnect ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A market-data server dies from one of two things: an unbounded per-client
 * queue, or a slow client holding up the fan-out. This keeps **no per-client
 * queue at all** once a subscription is live. When a socket's own outbound
 * buffer is over the high-water mark:
 *
 *   1. the delta is DROPPED, not queued. Dropping is safe here and only here,
 *      because the next frame the client accepts will not line up and its own
 *      gap check fires. Silence is never the failure mode — see (2).
 *   2. the client is marked lagging. On the first tick where its buffer has
 *      drained, it gets a full SNAPSHOT rather than the deltas it missed. The
 *      lag sweep runs on every tick, including ticks where nothing changed, so
 *      a client that lagged into a quiet market still gets repaired instead of
 *      sitting on a book it believes is current.
 *   3. a client that is still over the mark after `maxLagTicks` consecutive
 *      ticks cannot absorb a top-N book in several seconds. That is not a
 *      trading client, and it is disconnected. Coalescing forever would let one
 *      dead TCP connection pin a book snapshot per tick indefinitely.
 *
 * Replaying missed deltas was the alternative and it is the wrong trade: the
 * replay buffer is unbounded in exactly the case you need it (a client that is
 * slow *because* the market is fast), while a snapshot is bounded by
 * `WS_DEPTH_LIMIT` and repairs any amount of lag in one frame.
 *
 * ── Snapshot-then-delta ordering ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A connection is registered BEFORE its snapshot is produced, because the other
 * order loses every delta that lands in the gap. Between registration and the
 * first frame, deltas are buffered rather than sent — if one went out first the
 * client would have no book to apply it to and would drop it, which is the
 * classic bug. The snapshot is then taken from the hub's CURRENT book at flush
 * time, not from whatever was current when the connection opened, so the
 * buffered deltas are normally already inside it and are discarded by
 * sequence. The replay loop still exists and still runs; it is a guard on an
 * invariant, not decoration, and there is a test that drives frames through
 * `applyDelta` to prove the client can rebuild the server's exact book.
