 * open meant a borrower's second loan in the same asset shared the first's
 * collateral, so releasing one could unsecure the other with every posting
 * balancing — the `hold` bug again, on the one lock kind whose entire job is to

 *
 * The bug this exists to stop is silent by construction. Per the 2026-08-02
 * ADR, the vendored product's money controllers keep their business logic and
 * have only their balance writes redirected into this ledger through an
 * adapter. Their member ids are `bigint`; ours are `uuid`; `owner_id` is `text`
 * and took either. Hand `String(member.id)` to `userAvailable()` and the post
 * succeeds: a second `user` account opens for a human who already has one, and
 * because both rows are individually well-formed, sum-to-zero holds, the hash
 * chain verifies, reconciliation replays clean and every gate goes green. There
 * is no reading of the book from which you could tell. The user simply has two
 * balances and can only see one.

 * of a transaction that ALREADY COMMITTED returns the original even while
 * frozen: the value moved, and telling a caller otherwise would have it retry a
 * movement that already happened."
 *
 * Validation is the same case. The first time a validation rule is tightened,
 * every uncommitted retry of an older body starts failing — and a caller told
 * "invalid" about money that has already moved will either retry forever or
 * compensate for a movement that was never lost. Returning the committed
 * transaction is the honest answer, and it is what the book actually contains.
