# Wave D doctrine scans — 2026-07-30

**Why this file:** `docs/audit/WAVE-D-2026-07-30.md` already exists on tip (product-batch narrative). This file is the **re-run gate log** with real exit codes from this worktree.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Tip | `5c291b5` (`origin/main` at run — Wave D grind loop high-water #151) |
| Worktree | `.worktrees/docs-audit-wave-d-run` · branch `docs/audit-wave-d-run` |
| When (UTC) | 2026-07-30T01:53:51Z |
| Runner | `node tooling/ci/*` and `node tooling/scripts/tracker.mjs` (no invent) |
| GitHub Actions | still **billing-blocked** — local gates only; not a CI green claim |

## Verdict

| Gate | Result | Exit | Last line / note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm scan:brand` | **GREEN** | 0 | `✓ brand-scan clean — 568 files, 0 forbidden names (Doctrine §0.7)` |
| `pnpm scan:custody` | **GREEN** | 0 | `✓ custody-scan clean — 67 files across 3 Protocol Plane service(s)` |
| `pnpm scan:vendor-shell` | **GREEN** | 0 | `✓ vendor-shell-scan clean — 1107 vendor file(s), 7 hazard pattern(s)` |
| `pnpm scan:workspace` | **GREEN** | 0 | `✓ workspace-sync clean — 16 service(s) reach both the image and the fleet` |
| `pnpm tracker:check` | **RED** | 1 | `✖ stale: docs/TRACKER.md` · fix: run `pnpm tracker` and commit |
| `pnpm scan:i18n` | **GREEN** (warn) | 0 | 1 possible hardcoded string: `apps/web/src/components/app-shell.tsx:41` `aria-label="Modules"` |
| migration-check | **GREEN** | 0 | `✓ migration-check clean — 22 migration(s) across 12 service(s), all reversible` |
| `node tooling/ci/dod-gate.mjs` | **RED** | 1 | DoD gate failed: `svc-notify` — no OpenTelemetry instrumentation (§14). 15 other services clean. Manual sign-offs still open (e2e CI, i18n, Grafana SLO panel, kill-switch). |

**Doctrine scans (brand / custody / vendor-shell / workspace): all green.**  
**Honest reds:** tracker markdown stale; DoD gate red on `svc-notify` OTEL only (pre-existing, not introduced by docs).

## Commands that were run (verbatim)

```bash
node tooling/ci/brand-scan.mjs
node tooling/ci/custody-scan.mjs
node tooling/ci/vendor-shell-scan.mjs
node tooling/ci/workspace-sync.mjs
node tooling/scripts/tracker.mjs --check
node tooling/ci/i18n-scan.mjs
node tooling/ci/migration-check.mjs
node tooling/ci/dod-gate.mjs
```

Full `pnpm verify` (turbo build/typecheck/test) was **not** run this pass — no install in this worktree; scans above are pure Node and need no `node_modules` for these scripts.

## Not claimed

- GitHub Actions green
- Full monorepo test suite
- Tracker regenerated (out of scope for this scan log; separate hygiene PR)
- `svc-notify` OTEL fix

## Operator next

1. `pnpm tracker` + commit when ready (clears tracker:check red)
2. Human: GitHub Actions billing
3. Optional later: OTEL on `svc-notify` so DoD gate can go green
