 * THE IDENTIFIER SPACE OF `ownerId` (§4.2).
 *
 * `owner_type` has always said what *role* an owner plays. It has never said
 * which *identifier space* `owner_id` is drawn from, and `owner_id` is `text`,
 * so it accepted anything.
 *
 * That mattered the moment the 2026-08-02 ADR accepted keeping the vendored
 * product's money controllers and redirecting their balance writes into this
 * ledger through an adapter. `identity.users.id` is a `uuid`; the vendored
 * `member.id` is a `bigint`. An adapter that hands over the wrong one does not
 * fail — it opens a SECOND perfectly conformant account for the same human.
 * Both accounts sum to zero, both hash-chain, both reconcile, both are
 * non-negative. Every gate reports clean and the book is quietly dual. That is
 * the exact failure the ADR was written to close, walking back in through the
 * adapter.
 *
 * So the ledger declares the space rather than inferring it from the caller:
 *
 *   user, subaccount            → a lowercase canonical UUID
 *   module, house, treasury     → a platform slug, e.g. `fees:trade`
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a separate `owner_ns` column. A namespace column is supplied
 * by the same caller that supplies the id, so an adapter passing a bigint would
 * pass `ns='member'` alongside it and the pair would be accepted. It relocates
 * the hole. The space has to be a function of something the ledger already
 * knows, and `owner_type` is that thing.
 *
 * Mirrored EXACTLY by `accounts_owner_id_space_ck`
 * (svc-ledger/drizzle/0005_owner_identifier_space.sql). The database is the
 * enforcement; this is the early, legible failure. Equivalence between the two
 * is asserted case-for-case in svc-ledger/src/ledger/owner-identity.pg.test.ts.
