/**
 * THE SCHEMA DRIFT GATE.
 *
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG, AND WHY A TEST RATHER THAN CARE.
 *
 * `drizzle/*.sql` and `src/db/schema.ts` are two descriptions of one database.
 * The migrations have run against real data and are immutable; `schema.ts` has
 * never run against anything. Nothing kept them honest, so `schema.ts` fell
 * four migrations behind: no `purpose` column, the pre-0001 identity index,
 * and none of the eight CHECK constraints.
 *
 * A stale ORM file is normally a nuisance. This one was a loaded gun, because
 * `schema.ts` is an INPUT to a code generator. Diffing the drifted file against
 * a snapshot of the database as it actually is emits 21 statements, of which
 * fifteen drop something. All 21 are reproduced in schema.ts's header; the ones
 * that matter are:
 *
 *     ALTER TABLE "ledger"."accounts" DROP CONSTRAINT "accounts_hold_purposed_ck";
 *     ALTER TABLE "ledger"."accounts" DROP CONSTRAINT "accounts_non_negative_ck";
 *     ALTER TABLE "ledger"."accounts" DROP CONSTRAINT "accounts_owner_id_space_ck";
 *     ALTER TABLE "ledger"."ledger_entries" DROP CONSTRAINT "ledger_entries_positive_ck";
 *     DROP INDEX "ledger"."accounts_identity_purpose_idx";
 *     ALTER TABLE "ledger"."accounts" DROP COLUMN "purpose";
 *
 * Every database-level money invariant in §4.2, removed by someone doing nothing
 * worse than regenerating a migration in good faith. Reviewing that diff would
 * require noticing which few of twenty-one lines are the ones that stop two
 * loans in one asset unsecuring each other.
 *
 * So the gate is not "remember to check". It is: build the database BOTH ways
 * and require them to be the same database.
 *
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS.
 *
 *   Side A — the truth. A per-run database with `drizzle/*.sql` applied
 *            verbatim, in order. This is what production has.
 *   Side B — the claim. A per-run database with the DDL drizzle-kit generates
 *            from `schema.ts` against an empty state. That is the whole of what
 *            this file asserts the database looks like, expressed as SQL by the
 *            same generator that would later be asked to migrate towards it.
 *
 * Then both are read back out of `pg_catalog` / `information_schema` and
 * compared: columns, constraints (including every CHECK), indexes, enums.
 *
 *
 * WHY THE COMPARISON IS THROUGH POSTGRES AND NOT THROUGH drizzle-kit.
 *
 * The obvious gate is `pushSchema()` — ask drizzle-kit to diff `schema.ts`
 * against a live database and assert it wants to change nothing. It cannot be
 * used here: on drizzle-kit 0.30.6 it throws while introspecting this schema,
 *
 *     TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
 *       at fromDatabase (drizzle-kit/api.js:30718)
 *
 * — before producing any statement at all, for `schema.ts` correct and drifted
 * alike. A gate that cannot run is not a gate.
 *
 * It would be the wrong shape even if it ran. Push compares drizzle-kit's own
 * rendering of `schema.ts` against its own re-parse of what it pulled back out
 * of Postgres, so the two sides are normalised by different code paths and
 * disagree on formatting: parenthesisation of a CASE expression, the spelling
 * of a numeric default, the presence of a cast. Each disagreement is a
 * difference the gate would report against a clean tree — and a gate that fires
 * on a clean tree gets disabled, after which the real drift walks through the
 * hole where it used to be.
 *
 * Both sides of THIS comparison are rendered by the same Postgres deparser, so
 * formatting, parenthesisation, quoting, casing and type-cast spelling are
 * normalised away before anything is compared. That is what lets the assertion
 * be exact — no allowlist of "known acceptable differences", because such a
 * list is where a dropped constraint eventually goes to hide.
 *
 * The cost is two `CREATE DATABASE` round trips. The thing it protects is every
 * money invariant §4.2 pushed down into the database on purpose.
 *
 *
 * WHEN THIS TEST GOES RED.
 *
 * Almost always the fix is to correct `schema.ts`, because the migrations have
 * already run somewhere and it has not. Changing an applied migration to match
 * the ORM file is rewriting history and is never the answer. If the database
 * genuinely needs to change, write a NEW migration (backfill before you
 * constrain) and then update `schema.ts` to match it.
 *
 * H8a PG-hard: this file never `describe.skip` / `postgresAvailable`. CI uses
 * TEST_DATABASE_URL (per-run database via `createTestDatabase` so catalog
 * snapshots stay on the real `ledger` schema). Local without that env starts
 * Testcontainers `postgres:16-alpine`. Docker/PG down is a failed suite, not a
 * green skip.
