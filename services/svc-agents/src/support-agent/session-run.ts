/**
 * Support agent Stage-2 — the metered `support.reply` RUN.
 *
 * Spec: docs/ops/trk/agents.support.md Stage 2 ("KB tool after ops.support
 * Stage 1+ / read-only account projection tool / typed I-don't-know + escalate
 * path"), §1.5 "Escalation to a human ticket is first-class".
 *
 * Everything the support agent needed to *decide* already existed and was pure:
 * `guardrail.ts` declares the toolset and keeps every money tool off it,
 * `tier-gate.ts` refuses closed until product law is published, `data-tools.ts`
 * refuses a dark desk / a missing row / somebody else's ticket, and
 * `supportAnswerOrEscalate` is the typed "I don't know". None of it ever ran on
 * the fleet runtime, so a support answer was a guardrail nobody enforced at call
 * time and a usage nobody metered. This module is the missing verb: it drives
 * those same pure functions through `openSession → act → settle → closeSession`,
 * the identical path `scanner/session-run.ts` (#1114) and
 * `navigator/session-run.ts` (#1150) take — not a parallel one.
 *
 * ── Why every ask goes to `runtime.act`, including the ones we expect to fail ──
 *
 * It would be cheaper to filter an undeclared tool out here and never bother the
 * runtime with it. That is exactly the shape of bug #1114 was written to stop: a
 * guardrail that only ever sees calls a caller already decided were fine is not
 * enforcing anything, and the refusal never reaches `agent_actions`, so the audit
 * trail shows a session in which nothing was ever attempted.
 *
 * So the run asks for what it was asked for. The runtime decides. That matters
 * most for the one case that is not hypothetical: the tier matrix is
 * **caller-supplied product law**, and a matrix that granted `pay.refund` would
 * sail through the tier gate. It does not sail through the session guardrail —
 * no money tool is declared on `supportAgentGuardrail()`, so `act` refuses it and
 * `execute` is never reached. The refund is not attempted because the guardrail
 * said no, not because this file remembered to check.
 *
 * ── Why a support agent may not answer around a gap ──────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the agent whose wrong answer a user acts on. "Your account is fine",
 * "that refund is on its way", "your limit is X" — each is a sentence about
 * somebody's money, and a confident wrong one is worse than no sentence at all.
 * So there is no branch in this file that composes a reply from nothing:
 *
 * - a reply is grounded in the article keys `support.kb.search` actually
 *   returned, and in nothing else;
 * - a KB that refused, came back empty, or was never consulted **escalates to a
 *   person** — the typed `agents.support.escalated`, not a hedge sentence;
 * - a run where no read at all was reachable **refuses** — an `ok` carrying an
 *   empty finding list would read like an answer;
 * - a request to move money escalates before a session opens. Refunds and
 *   credits are `ops.support` + `packages/ledger-client` recipes. The support
 *   agent never posts (§0.6), and reading the KB to discover that would bill a
 *   user for a lookup that cannot change the outcome.
 *
 * Findings are echoes of what a tool returned. No field is defaulted, rounded,
 * or reconstructed on the way out.
 *
 * ── What this module deliberately does NOT do ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not price, post, hold or total anything. The only money verb here is
 * `runtime.settleSession`, which is `UsageMeter` → `packages/ledger-client`. The
 * support agent never calls `ledger.post` (§0.6). Amounts are scaled bigint from
 * the meter and leave as decimal strings.
 *
 * It also does not register the guardrail. Registration is a deployment act (see
 * `registerScannerAgent`), and a run that registered its own guardrail on the way
 * in could widen its own powers. There is no support twin of that function here
 * on purpose: the scanner one is called from nowhere today, and adding a second
 * dead registrar would make boot registration *look* wired while nothing writes
 * to `agent_definitions`.
 *
 * ── Why a run that reads fixtures bills zero, honestly ───────────────────────
 *
 * The metered thing in this service is the ENGINE (`runtime.think`), and this
 * run does not call it: a reply grounded in cited article keys is data movement,
 * not a completion. So the run opens no usage window and settles to `0`. That
 * zero is reported as what it is. A synthetic charge so the run "looks metered"
 * would be a fabricated cost, and a fabricated cost is the same class of lie as
 * a fabricated answer.
