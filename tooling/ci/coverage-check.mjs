/**
 * COVERAGE CHECK — the gate §25:740 specified and nobody built.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * ────────────────────
 * `INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md` §25, line 740, says verbatim:
 *
 *   "Coverage check: every named feature in Vol. I chapters I–XIX appears above
 *    exactly once with an owner and phase. CI carries `coverage-check`: this
 *    matrix is machine-readable (`tooling/coverage.yaml`); any Vol. I feature
 *    without a green DoD at its phase gate blocks the drop phase that promised
 *    it. Never half done — enforced."
 *
 * Neither the file nor the job existed. The consequence, found by hand in
 * `docs/audit/BUILD-COVERAGE-AUDIT-2026-08-03.md`: forty law-specified
 * capabilities with no tracker row, twenty of which are the whole of §27–§37 —
 * every word of law written after v2.0, with zero board presence, and nothing
 * anywhere saying so. Two of those twenty are phased at 2, the phase being
 * worked now. That audit had to be done by hand precisely because the machine
 * that was supposed to answer the question was never built.
 *
 * This gate is that machine. It answers one question on every push: is anything
 * in the law absent from the board without someone having said so out loud? —
 * and its mirror, is anything on the board claiming a law that does not say it?
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS
 * ───────────────
 *   1. Every `## N ·` chapter of the law appears in `sections:` — so a chapter
 *      cannot be written and go unnoticed the way §27–§37 did.
 *   2. Every capability cites a law line that RESOLVES: the section exists and
 *      the line falls inside it. An invented cite fails.
 *   3. Every capability is exactly one of: mapped to tracker rows · `exempt`
 *      with a written reason and a recorded decision · `gap` with an audit cite.
 *      There is no fourth state, and silence is not one of the three.
 *   4. Every tracker row is claimed by a capability, or listed in
 *      `tracker_extra` with a basis that exists on disk. Both directions.
 *   5. The ratchet: the SET of gap ids and of orphan ids must equal the recorded
 *      baseline, by name. New drift fails on arrival; closing drift fails until
 *      the line comes out in the same PR. See "LANDING" below.
 *   6. Drop phases (§11): a phase marked `promised: true` whose capabilities
 *      are not all `done` fails — that is §25's "blocks the drop phase that
 *      promised it", enforced at the moment someone actually promises one.
 *
 * LANDING — why a ratchet and not a red gate
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Forty missing rows means a strict gate is red on `main` the hour it lands,
 * and a gate that is red on arrival gets disabled within a day. The two ways
 * out of that are (a) narrow what it checks until it passes — which recreates
 * the exact blindness this exists to fix — or (b) write today's gaps down, NAME
 * them, and refuse to let the set grow. This is (b). Precedent in this repo:
 * `BASELINE` in `fabricated-money-scan.mjs`, where every frozen finding is
 * written out by its exact text and matched exactly.
 *
 * Named, and not counted, for one specific reason. The first version of this
 * gate froze two integers — `gaps: 41`, `orphans: 1` — and an integer cannot
 * distinguish "nothing changed" from "one closed and one opened". A PR that
 * fixes one gap and introduces another leaves the count at 41 and goes green
 * over exactly the new drift the ratchet was built to stop. Identity has no
 * such hole: the new id is not in the list, and it fails on arrival.
 *
 * The ratchet is two-way on purpose. An id that is a gap today and is not in the
 * baseline is new drift and fails loudly. An id in the baseline that is no
 * longer a gap ALSO fails, because a baseline allowed to sit above the truth
 * silently re-opens the window it was meant to close — and is the room a swap
 * would otherwise hide in.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO — a gate that cries wolf gets disabled
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It reads structured data only: this YAML, `tooling/tracker/features.mjs` as a
 * module, and the law's `## N ·` chapter headings. It does not grep prose, does
 * not pattern-match commentary, and skips fenced code blocks when indexing the
 * law, so an example that happens to look like a heading cannot fire it.
 *
 * DEVIATIONS FROM §25 AS WRITTEN — declared, not silent
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * See `tooling/coverage.yaml` → `meta.deviations`. Summary: Vol. I is a PDF and
 * is not machine-readable from this repo, so the enumerated axis is §25's own
 * matrix (plus the §30 and §38 addenda that extend it) rather than Vol. I
 * itself; and "owner" is read from the tracker row, which is where ownership
 * actually lives, rather than duplicated into this file.
 *
 * WHERE IT IS WIRED
 * ─────────────────
 * `pnpm verify` (after `tracker:check`, which it reads) and the `gates` job of
 * `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. That is how every other scan on `main` is wired.
 *
 * Wired through `tooling/ci/gates.mjs` (GATES entry `coverage`) and therefore
 * through `pnpm gates` / the `gates` job of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The
 * older note that said gates.mjs lived only on a stranded branch is obsolete —
 * gates.mjs is on main and this scan is one of its rows.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tooling/ci/coverage-check.mjs            run every check
 *   node tooling/ci/coverage-check.mjs --report   print the coverage report only

//
// BY NAME, NOT BY NUMBER. This was `gaps: 41` and `orphans: 1` — two integers
// compared against two counts — and that is a ratchet with a hole straight
// through the middle of it: close one gap in the same PR that opens another and
// the count is still 41, so the gate goes green over a swap it never saw. The
// two events cancel, and the one that cancels them is precisely the new drift
// this gate exists to catch. A count cannot tell "nothing changed" from "two
// things changed in opposite directions", and only one of those is fine.
//
// So the baseline records WHICH, exactly as `BASELINE` does in
// `tooling/ci/fabricated-money-scan.mjs`: every frozen row written out by its
// own identity, matched exactly, and failing in BOTH directions —
//
//   · an id that is a gap today and is not in the list  → NEW. Fail.
//   · an id in the list that is no longer a gap         → STALE. Fail, with the
//     line to delete. Good news still has to be written down, or the list
//     rots into blanket cover for things nobody looked at.
//
// It also makes the frozen debt legible. `41` names nothing; a list names the
// forty-one capabilities somebody has to come back for, and a reviewer can see
// which one a PR is actually moving.
