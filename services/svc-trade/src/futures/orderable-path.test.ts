/**
 * THE FUTURES ORDER PATH — REFUSED WHEN OFF, REAL WHEN ON, AND STILL NOT A
 * SELF-DEALING MACHINE.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `assertTradable` refused every non-spot market on the order path, so a futures
 * book could not be filled by anyone and was always empty.
 * `futures/mark-from-depth.ts` named that in its own header and was blunt about
 * what it was: **"a different file's accident, not a control"**, and it named the
 * change that would cash the accident in — "the change that makes futures markets
 * orderable turns this into self-dealing with two dust orders, no capital at risk,
 * and no further code needed."
 *
 * This is that change. So the burden is not "does a futures order work" — it is
 * proving that the thing the old refusal was accidentally protecting is now
 * protected on purpose. That is the third describe block below, and it is the
 * reason this file is not three assertions in `trade-service.test.ts`.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * AND THEN BLOCK 3 TURNED OUT TO BE MEASURING THE WRONG VARIABLE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Block 3 proves a book of FEMTO-CENTS mints no payout, and its control proved
 * that a book of 22,000 USDT does. Both were true. Neither asked the question
 * that mattered, which is not "is this book worth something" but **"is it worth
 * something NEXT TO THE POSITION IT IS PRICING"** — and between those two
 * numbers sat a working extraction: 240 USDT of resting quotes and 10 USDT of
 * margin, out with **190,000 USDT** of the profit pot.
 *
 * The control was the worse half of the pair. Titled "THE CONTROL, and it is not
 * optional", it rested two makers, let a third party take 2,000 USDT out of the
 * pot, and asserted that as CORRECT — with nothing in it establishing why that
 * book was good enough, nothing asking whether the three parties were the same
 * person, and no variable it varied. It would have passed identically had the
 * gate been checking nothing at all, which is precisely what a control must not
 * do. It is rewritten below to state the ratio that makes it legitimate, and
 * blocks 4 and 5 are the two properties nothing in this file was measuring:
 *
 *   · **4** — a mark must be backed by depth PROPORTIONAL to the position it
 *     pays out on. Same prices, same parties, same move; the resting size is the
 *     only thing that varies, once below the requirement and once above.
 *   · **5** — leverage has a ceiling. There was none: `grep -rn "MAX_LEVERAGE"`
 *     returned nothing and `numeric(8, 2)` was the only limit at 999,999.99x.
 *
 * Neither half is sufficient alone, and the two revert proofs in those blocks
 * are separate for that reason.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THE BOOK IS DERIVED FROM `trade.orders` AND NOT SET BY HAND
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `StubMatching.depth()` returns whatever a test assigns to `.bids` / `.asks`,
 * and every existing mark test uses that or an inline `async () => book`. Those
 * are the right tool for testing the mark ARITHMETIC, and they were the tool used
 * when the size-blind mid was found and fixed.
 *
 * They are the wrong tool here, because a hand-set book proves nothing about
 * reachability: it would pass identically on `main`, where no order can reach a
 * futures book at all. `bookFromOrders` reads `trade.orders` — the rows the real
 * `placeOrder` wrote after the real `assertTradable`, `assertQty`, `assertPrice`,
 * `assertNotional` and the real ledger hold — and turns them into depth. So the
 * dust in the third block got there the way an attacker would have to put it
 * there, and a market floor that refused it would show up as a red test rather
 * than as a quietly passing one.
 *
 * H8a PG-hard: this file never `describe.skip` / `postgresAvailable`. CI uses
 * TEST_DATABASE_URL (per-run `createTestDatabase`, not shared table mutations).
 * Local without that env starts Testcontainers `postgres:16-alpine`. Docker/PG
 * down is a failed suite, not a green skip.
