/**
 * TRANSPORT HARDENING — the two controls the front door was missing.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * svc-edge is the only component the internet reaches, and it proxies to every
 * service in the fleet. Until this file it sent no security headers at all, and
 * it counted nothing: there was no throttle of any kind on any path.
 *
 * The absent throttle is the sharper of the two. `/api/*` is a catch-all that
 * forwards to `resolve()`'s route table, and one of those routes is
 * svc-identity. A password guess and a legitimate login are the same request
 * shape to this process, so an unauthenticated caller could spend attempts at
 * whatever rate their socket allowed — against the component that mints the
 * bearer tokens the entire platform trusts. Nothing downstream compensates:
 * `exchangePrincipal` refuses a bad token cheaply and correctly, and refusing
 * cheaply a million times is still a million attempts.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
 *
 * **`@fastify/cors` does not replace `cors.ts`.** That file is hand-rolled for
 * properties the plugin does not offer: every `OPTIONS` terminated at the edge
 * and never proxied, a preflight answer computed from the `Origin` header alone
 * so it cannot be used as a route oracle, and allow-origin headers that survive
 * onto 404/502/503 refusals. Those are load-bearing and tested. Swapping them
 * for a plugin default would be a regression wearing the costume of a cleanup.
 *
 * **`@fastify/under-pressure` is not registered.** It answers 503 when event-loop
 * lag crosses a threshold. On a money platform that means shedding an order
 * cancel — the request a user most needs served — precisely when the system is
 * busiest. Load shedding is a product decision about which calls are droppable,
 * and nobody has made it. Serving slowly is not the same failure as refusing,
 * and this file will not quietly convert one into the other.

 *     error body. `apps/admin` sets its own policy over its own documents.
 *   · HSTS is off HERE. The edge terminates no TLS — nginx and the load
 *     balancer do — so a max-age emitted from behind them is a promise made by
 *     the component least able to keep it. It belongs at the TLS terminator,
 *     where somebody can see the certificate.
 *
 * What is left is the set that means something for an API: `nosniff`, a denied
 * frame ancestry, no cross-domain policies, and a referrer policy.
