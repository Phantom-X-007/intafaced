/**
 * TRANSFERS — the rails half of §8.1.
 *
 * Two paths: a one-off transfer a user asks for, and a standing order a
 * scheduler drives. The second is the dangerous one. A scheduler WILL fire
 * twice — a retry, a second replica, a clock stepping backwards over a DST
 * boundary, an operator re-running a job after an outage — so "exactly once"
 * cannot rest on the timer being well behaved.
 *
 * It rests on two independent things instead:
 *
 *   1. `unique(schedule_id, occurrence)` on `bank.transfer_executions`. The job
 *      CLAIMS the occurrence by inserting before it posts. A second run's insert
 *      conflicts and it does nothing.
 *   2. The ledger's idempotency key `bank.transfer:<scheduleId>:<occurrence>`.
 *      Even with the claim bypassed, the second post returns the first one's
 *      transaction rather than moving value again.
 *
 * They agree by construction: both are derived from the same (schedule,
 * occurrence) pair, and `occurrence` is computed from the schedule's anchor and
 * cadence — never from a counter, never from a clock reading.

   * day nobody chose, out of a space that may not hold it.
   *
   * So resume RECORDS the elapsed occurrences as `skipped` before it lifts the
   * pause. That is not bookkeeping garnish — `MAX(occurrence)` over
   * `bank.transfer_executions` IS `lastFired`, so writing the rows is what moves
   * the schedule's floor forward, and the same unique index that makes a
   * double-fire impossible makes a double-skip impossible. There is no second
   * mechanism, no `resumed_at` watermark to keep in step with the executions
   * table, and nothing that could disagree with it.
   *
   * The occurrence due at the instant of resume is skipped too. "Resume" means
   * the next scheduled movement, not this one: a rule a user can predict beats a
   * rule that depends on whether they clicked before or after 09:00.
   *
   * Two consequences worth stating plainly:
   *
   *   · resuming moves no value, ever. It posts nothing to the ledger.
   *   · an occurrence CLAIMED before the pause (a `pending` row, a process that
   *     died between claim and post) is protected by `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
   *     and stays pending, so the runner's stranded sweep still completes it.

  /**
   * Fire every standing order that is due, and finish every claim that was left
   * behind.
   *
   * Safe to run twice, concurrently, or after an outage. The claim row and the
   * ledger key both key on (schedule, occurrence), so the second run finds every
   * occurrence already taken and does nothing.
   *
   * TWO QUERIES, AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE IMPORTANT ONE.
   *
   * A `pending` row is an occurrence this service CLAIMED and never posted — a
   * process that died between the two. Sweeping it used to be a side effect of
   * the schedule being due again, which was true enough while every schedule was
   * either active or dead: tomorrow's pass would pick the row up.
   *
   * `pause` broke that, and it broke it silently. A paused schedule is never
   * selected by the due query, so a claim stranded before the pause would sit
   * there for as long as the user left the order paused — forever, if they never
   * resumed it — with no error raised anywhere and no way for the user to see
   * that a transfer they authorised had been half-performed. `resume` makes it
   * worse rather than better: it moves `next_run_at` PAST the stranded
   * occurrence, so even resuming does not bring the sweep back.
   *
   * So a stranded claim is now a reason to look at a schedule in its own right,
   * independent of `next_run_at` and independent of `status`. That last part is
   * deliberate: cancelling does not retract a claim either. Cancel stops FUTURE
   * firings and is explicitly not a reversal — an occurrence already claimed is
   * a movement this service committed to, and the honest completion of it is to
   * post it, not to leave a `pending` row nobody will ever explain.
   *
   * Sweeping never plans new occurrences and never advances `next_run_at`. It
   * finishes what was started and touches nothing else.
