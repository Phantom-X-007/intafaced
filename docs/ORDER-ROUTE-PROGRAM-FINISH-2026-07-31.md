# Order-route program finish gate (agent-complete)

**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**PR:** https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/pull/289  
**Rule:** Agent-complete ≠ go-live. Human X axes stay human forever.

## Definition of finished (this program)

Every Spec v1 REQ is either:

1. **Proven green** with test/scan/PR evidence, or
2. **Honest residual** with named owner, path, and why agent cannot close it.

No REQ left silent. No “stable for real money” claim (RS-2).

## Dual-book residual (DB-1 honesty)

Layers enforced:

1. DAO mutators no-op + Java money scan
2. Spring `DualBookMoneyDoorInterceptor` (HTTP)
3. Service entry throws (legal wallet, withdraw, sign-in, matchWallet)
4. Promotion reward mints short-circuited

**Residual:** unreachable dead-code `setBalance` lines inside `if (null)` / commented paths; non-merged seeder; full JVM 410 smoke not in CI.

**ADR:** dual-book Accepted on main with DIRECTION #272 era.

## WAVE-AUDIT (SC-5)

Money ships in this program pack (order-route #289 slices):

- Chaos F1–F8 + properties + reconcile
- Dual-book door + scans + service disable
- Seed flag + volume honesty + make-only

Archive this file as the WAVE-AUDIT for the order-route harden wave. Next WAVE-AUDIT after next 3–4 product money ships.

## Autonomous finish prompt (enhanced — paste next session)

```
Program: order-route Spec v1 + Plan. Scoreboard: docs/ORDER-ROUTE-READINESS-SCOREBOARD.md.
Finish gate: docs/ORDER-ROUTE-PROGRAM-FINISH-2026-07-31.md.
Autonomous: no Nitro choices; worktree → implement → verify → PR; only stop for Human X.
Closed REQs: do not re-open. Residuals only: fleet CX-8 two-user, dead setBalance, ops seeder compose boot, Human X.
If queue empty: re-derive Spec REQ matrix from tip; if all green/residual-named → report finished and STOP.
No go-live. No futures engine invent. Denon carve-out on posture merges.
