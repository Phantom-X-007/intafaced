# AGENT EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**Binding on every agent, every PR, every schema change. §15 of `INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md`.**

---

## 0 · Before you touch anything

1. Read `INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md`. It is the law, not context.
2. Read the target service's `README.md`.
3. Read this file.
4. Multi-dev: read `docs/COORDINATION-TRUTH-LAYERS.md` (or the coordination section in `AGENTS.md`). **Nitro does not paste this** — it is binding on cold start.
5. Internet leverage: read `docs/INTERNET-LEVERAGE-LAW.md` before product code. Prefer Phase A in-repo assets (shell, ledger, `svc-*`). **Do not ask Nitro for a pick list.**

If the task is ambiguous, **the doctrine (§0) decides**. If the doctrine does not decide, **stop and ask D.** Do not guess on money, custody, or jurisdiction.

---

## 1 · Scope of a task

**One service per task.** A PR touches one `services/*` directory plus, at most, its own tests and README.

Cross-service work is **two PRs, in order**:

1. A `packages/contracts` and/or `packages/events` PR that declares the new interface or event. Reviewed on its own.
2. The service PR that implements against it.

Never the reverse. Never both at once. The contract is the design review.

---

## 2 · Hard prohibitions

These are not style preferences. A PR that does any of them is rejected without discussion.

## 3 · Every PR must pass

```bash
pnpm verify           # everything below, in this order — run this one
```

`pnpm verify` is:

```bash
pnpm gates            # 29 doctrine gates, ~2s — brand §0.7 · custody §16.10 ·
                      # secrets · vendor-shell · vendor-java-money ·
                      # dual-book door + door-paths · test-db isolation ·
                      # killswitch §14.6 · migrations §14 · workspace · tracker ·
                      # agent-autoload · i18n (advisory)
pnpm format:check     # prettier
pnpm build            # turbo
pnpm typecheck        # no `any` escapes, no implicit widening
pnpm test             # unit + invariant suites
pnpm gate             # the full §14 Definition of Done, per service
```

**CI runs the same gate list from the same file** — `tooling/ci/gates.mjs`. That is deliberate: verify and CI used to keep separate lists and drifted, so two gates ran in CI and nowhere local. The file fails if `.github/workflows/ci.yml` stops calling `pnpm gates`, and fails if a scan lands in `tooling/ci/` that neither the list nor its documented exclusions claim.

A red gate is not a discussion.

**Run the local equivalents green before the push that opens/updates a code PR** — local is seconds, a CI round trip is minutes. That is the only reason: the repo is **public**, so Actions on standard runners are free and unlimited and there is nothing to ration. Parallel PRs are unlimited, and finished work is never held back to keep a run count down. Never weaken a gate for any reason. (The old "Actions thrift" law was deleted 2026-08-07 — retirement note: `docs/GITHUB-CI-SPEND-CONTROL-2026-07-31.md`.)

## 4 · Writing a service

Follow `tooling/agent-protocol/SERVICE_TEMPLATE.md`. The shape is not optional — uniformity is what lets an agent work in `svc-pay` on Monday and `svc-academy` on Tuesday without re-learning anything.

```

## 5 · Money paths

A "money path" is any code that leads to `ledger.post()`. It carries stricter rules:

- **≥ 95% unit coverage.** Not aspirational — measured.
- **Every recipe has an invariant test.** Sum-to-zero, no negative available, no stranded funds on any branch.
- **Every failure branch is tested.** Insufficient funds, rail failure, dispute resolution, partial fill, cancel-during-fill.
- **Idempotency keys are business keys.** `deposit:crypto-native:0xabc`, never `crypto.randomUUID()`. A retry must find the original.
- **Trace attribute `intafaced.money_path=true`** so the collector never samples it away.

Ask of every money path: _if this crashes exactly here, whose funds are stranded?_ If the answer is anyone's, the design is wrong.

---

## 6 · Events

- Subject: `intafaced.<service>.<entity>.<verb>`. Past tense. Declared in the catalog.
- Consumers are idempotent. Wrap with `idempotent(handler, store, scope)` — at-least-once delivery is the only delivery.
- Payloads are versioned. Breaking a payload = new version + both running until consumers migrate.
- Money amounts are decimal strings in payloads. Always.

---

## 7 · Jurisdiction and custody

Before serving any user-facing operation:

```ts
const decision = checkAccess({ module, plane, region, kycTier });
if (!decision.allowed) throw forbidden(decision.reason);
```

Or declare it on the procedure: `scopedProcedure('trade:write', { module: 'trade' })`.

**The sovereignty law (§22) is not a policy toggle — it follows custody:**

- Platform never holds the asset → permissionless. No KYC. No account gate.
- Platform holds the asset or touches fiat/card rails → tiered verification per the matrix.

If you find yourself writing a KYC check on the Protocol Plane, stop. Either the module is custodial and belongs on the Fiat Plane, or the check is wrong.

---

## 8 · Definition of Done

A module ships when `pnpm gate <service>` is green **and** the manual checklist it prints is signed. Not before.

Doctrine §0.1: _"A module ships when its Definition of Done passes — not before, and nothing 'temporary' survives to the next phase."_
