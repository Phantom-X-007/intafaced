 * FOREIGN KEY is the same shape one level down: it destroys an invariant rather
 * than data, silently, and every row written afterwards is written without it.

/**
 * Constraints and indexes that are dropped and NEVER PUT BACK.
 *
 * `DROP CONSTRAINT` cannot be a flat pattern here. Every migration in this repo
 * opens with the idempotent re-create idiom —
 *
 *     ALTER TABLE … DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS "orders_hold_positive_ck";
 *     ALTER TABLE … ADD  CONSTRAINT        "orders_hold_positive_ck" CHECK (…);
 *
 * — so a flat rule flagged 28 of 48 migrations, none of which lose anything.
 * That is worse than no rule: a gate that fires on the house style trains
 * everyone to paste the acknowledgement without reading it, and then it is
 * decoration on the one migration that really does drop an invariant.
 *
 * So the check is the DIFFERENCE: dropped names minus restored names. A
 * constraint re-added under the SAME name in the SAME file is a re-create. One
 * that is not is a real loss and needs the acknowledgement — which is exactly
 * how `0006_paper_markets.sql` is caught, because it drops
 * `orders_hold_positive_ck` and adds `orders_hold_non_negative_ck`: a different
 * name, a genuinely relaxed rule, and previously invisible to this gate.
