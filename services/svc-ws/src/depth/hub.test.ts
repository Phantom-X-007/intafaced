/**
 * THE FAN-OUT, FROM THE CLIENT'S SIDE.
 *
 * Almost every assertion here goes through `rebuild()`, which does exactly what
 * `apps/web`'s `DepthController` does: take the first snapshot, apply every
 * delta with `@intafaced/market-data`'s `applyDelta`, and REFUSE anything that
 * does not continue. If the server ever emits a `fromSequence` that does not
 * line up, `applyDelta` returns `{ ok: false, reason: 'gap' }` and `rebuild`
 * throws — which is the whole safety property, asserted from the side that has
 * to live with it rather than from the side that produces it.
 *
 * That is deliberate. A test that checked `delta.fromSequence === previous`
 * would pass on a server that renumbered both consistently and shipped a book
 * nobody could rebuild.

/**
 * WHICH LIST DECIDES.
 *
 * The bug that made live depth unreachable for twenty-six cycles was not in any
 * of the fan-out above. It was that this hub asked svc-matching "what are the
 * markets?", and svc-matching answered with the books it holds — which, after
 * `trade.markets` was reseeded, had an EMPTY intersection with the ids the
 * browser fetches to draw the market picker. Sixteen listed, ten in the engine,
 * nothing in common, every subscription refused with `unknown market`.
 *
 * So the hub now takes a registry that is separate from its depth source, and
 * these are the two facts that must hold: the listing decides, and a listed
 * market with no book still opens.
