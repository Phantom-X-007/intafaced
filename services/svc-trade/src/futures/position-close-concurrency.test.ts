/**
 * CONCURRENT AND REPLAYED CLOSES PAY REALISED PROFIT EXACTLY ONCE.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `close()` used to run: `SELECT … status='open'` → read the mark → bound check
 * → `ledger.post` × N → `UPDATE … status='closed'`. No lock, no transaction, and
 * an idempotency key minted per ATTEMPT rather than per CLOSE:
 *
 *     closeId: `close:${row.id}:${randomUUID()}`
 *
 * `futuresRealizeProfit` keys on `futures.profit:${profitId}`, so a fresh UUID
 * meant the ledger could not dedupe and every concurrent attempt was a genuinely
 * new payout. `futuresMarginRelease` keys on `positionId:sequence` and WAS
 * deduped — which is why only the payout multiplied, and why counting HTTP 200s
 * would have looked fine.
 *
 * Eight concurrent DELETEs on one position paid 5000 of honest PnL eight times.
 * The payout bound did not save it: each attempt read the pot's balance BEFORE
 * any of them had drained it, so the bound capped the theft at the pot's total
 * balance rather than at the honest PnL. It is the ADR's own sentence failing in
 * a new disguise — the party being paid still chose the amount, this time via N
 * instead of via `exitPrice`.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THE MARK IS SLOW HERE, AND WHY THAT IS NOT A RIGGED TEST
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The race needs a yield between reading the row and writing it. In production
 * there is always a wide one: `markFor()` is an HTTP round trip to the venue
 * fabric or the matching book. A memory mark book resolves immediately and
 * leaves only the microtask boundaries — measured against the unfixed service,
 * that was still enough to double-pay two concurrent closes (110000 instead of
 * 105000), but nothing like enough to interleave eight reliably.
 *
 * `slowMarks()` puts 25 ms back, and with it the real shape: eight concurrent
 * closes paid 5000 eight times over (140000), and sixteen drained the pot to the
 * floor (150000, +50000 — the entire pot). 25 ms is not a pessimistic number for
 * an HTTP round trip, it is a generous one.
 *
 * ASSERTIONS ARE BALANCES, never response codes. A duplicate payout is a number
 * in the ledger; a 200 is an opinion about one.
