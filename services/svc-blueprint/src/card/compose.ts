/**
 * THE SHARE CARD (§7.1, §7.2).
 *
 * §7.1 calls this "the acquisition artifact, treat it as a product", and §7.2
 * makes it an exit criterion: "Card renders pixel-perfect at share sizes
 * (1080×1350, 1200×630); no third-party system names anywhere in output".
 *
 * This file is the whole card. It is a **pure function**: profile and crew in,
 * SVG out. No clock, no randomness, no network, no database. That is not
 * fastidiousness — it is what makes every claim below testable:
 *
 *   · "pixel-perfect at 1080×1350" is an assertion about two integers in the
 *     output, not about what a rasterizer felt like doing.
 *   · "no third-party system names anywhere in output" is a copy-scan over a
 *     string this process produced, which is why `brand.test.ts` — which walks
 *     every file in this package — is a real check on the shipped artifact and
 *     not merely on the source that builds it.
 *   · The same Blueprint always yields a byte-identical card, so re-sharing is
 *     idempotent and a diff in CI means somebody changed the design.
 *
 * ── Why SVG, when §7.1 says PNG ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §7.1 names the vendor path — a rasterizer, then a PNG. Doctrine §0.4 makes
 * that rasterizer a *rail*: an adapter, behind an interface, that the platform
 * "never depends on to function". So the split is deliberate:
 *
 *   composition (this file)  = ours, always works, needs nothing
 *   rasterization (adapter)  = external, may be absent, refuses loudly
 *
 * The SVG is not a preview or a fallback. It is a complete, resolution-
 * independent card that a user can download, print, or post. What needs the
 * rasterizer is a *hosted PNG* at a URL, because that is what a social platform
 * fetches for an unfurl — and when there is no renderer we say so rather than
 * inventing a URL.
 *
 * ── What is deliberately NOT on this card ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **No personal data. None.** No name, no handle, no avatar, no birth data, no
 * user id, no dates that could pin a person down. Everything drawn here is
 * either derived by the Neural Engine (the five axes) or a crew's public name.
 *
 * That is a design decision with two consequences worth stating, because both
 * are the reason for it:
 *
 *  1. A card carrying no personal data is safe to make public by default. The
 *     acquisition artifact is the one object in this service explicitly meant to
 *     leave it, and §10 isolation is much easier to guarantee for a thing that
 *     never had anything to isolate.
 *
 *  2. It is unspoofable-by-omission. A card with a caller-supplied display name
 *     would be a public image endpoint that renders arbitrary text in INTAFACED
 *     branding — which is a defacement surface, not a share feature. Whether
 *     users may put their own name on a card is a product call with an abuse
 *     dimension, and it belongs to the owner, not to this file.
