/**
 * THE OPERATOR KILL-SWITCH, AT THE FRONT DOOR (§14.6).
 *
 * ── What was actually there before this file ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `packages/config/src/flags.ts` has held a complete kill-switch model since
 * the beginning: `FlagContext.disabledModules`, and `isEnabled()` giving it
 * precedence over everything else. `services/svc-protocol/src/index.ts` exports
 * `setRelayEnabled(next)`; `services/svc-indexer/src/index.ts` exports
 * `setIngestEnabled(next)`. Both are commented "the kill-switch surface
 * `apps/admin` reaches".
 *
 * **Nothing reached them.** They are module-scope functions in a service entry
 * point, exported to a process that no other process can call. `apps/admin`
 * held its staged overrides in React state and said so on its own face:
 * "Staged changes are held in this browser session and have not been sent
 * anywhere." Every service that mirrors a flag — `TRADE_SPOT_ENABLED`,
 * `WS_GATEWAY_ENABLED`, `PROTOCOL_RELAY_ENABLED`, `EMISSIONS_ENABLED` — reads
 * it from the environment ONCE, at boot. The only way an operator could switch
 * anything off was to edit compose and restart the fleet.
 *
 * A kill-switch that requires a deploy is not a kill-switch. §14.6 asks for one
 * an operator can reach, and this is the first thing in the platform that is
 * reachable.
 *
 * ── Why the edge, and not each service ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Because the edge is the one component every request already passes through,
 * and because a switch that lives in fifteen processes has to be flipped
 * fifteen times — which is exactly the property you do not want in the ninety
 * seconds when you need it.
 *
 * This does NOT replace the in-service switches. `TradeService.placeOrder`
 * still refuses when `trade.spot` is off, and it should: the edge is a
 * perimeter, and a perimeter is not a substitute for the guard on the vault.
 * Defence in depth means both, and the one that can be flipped without a deploy
 * is the one an operator can actually use.
 *
 * ── The rule that makes it a safety control rather than a trap ──────────────
 *
 * A killed module refuses NEW COMMITMENTS and keeps LETTING PEOPLE OUT. That is
 * §14's own example — "`trade.spot` disabled refuses new orders while still
 * allowing cancels" — and `services/svc-trade/src/router.ts` says the same
 * thing about its own cancel path: "An operator who has halted a market must
 * still let users out; a control that traps funds is not a safety control."
 *
 * So: reads always pass, releases always pass, everything else is refused with
 * 503. Both lists are short and explicit rather than clever — an operator
 * reading this file must be able to say what a kill does without running it.
 */

/**
 * The prefix → module map, taken from the route table's own `module` field.
 *
 * Derived from data rather than from the prefix STRING, which is the bug this
 * replaced: `/api/v1` forwards to `svc-trade` but does not spell "trade", so a
 * map built by stripping `/api/` either threw at boot or — worse — left the
 * public CCXT order path with no module and therefore un-killable. See the

 * Release paths that are NOT tRPC, and the second bug this file had.

 * every ccxt client actually uses —
 *
 *   POST   /api/v1/orders        place

 *   DELETE /api/v1/orders        cancel all (?symbol=)
 *
 * A REST path has no tRPC procedure, so `procedureOf` returned null and the
 * request fell through to "an unknown shape is a commitment" — refused. Halting
 * `trade` would have blocked `DELETE /api/v1/orders/:id`, which is a user with
 * an open order and no way to close it. That is the precise failure the
 * asymmetry exists to prevent, and it failed in the trapping direction: the
 * un-killable-prefix bug let too much through, this one let nothing out.
 *
 * Enumerated rather than generalised to "DELETE is always safe". DELETE happens
 * to be release-shaped across this platform today, but that is a fact about the

/**
 * The path this request will actually reach an upstream on — or null when there

 *
 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES: TWO PARSERS, TWO ANSWERS
 *
 * The guard used to prefix-match the RAW target (`req.url.split('?')[0]`). The
 * proxy handler then re-read the same request with `new URL(req.url, …)`, and
 * the WHATWG parser removes dot segments. So the two disagreed about which
 * module a request was for, and the disagreement was exploitable:
 *
 *   POST /api/trade/../identity/trpc/auth.login
 *
 * The guard saw `/api/trade` — not killed — and waved it through. The proxy
 * resolved `/api/identity/...` and forwarded it to the halted service. The
 * console kept reporting identity as disabled and no 503 was ever logged: the
 * exact failure the fail-closed comment in control-plane.ts describes, arrived
 * at from the other direction.
 *
 * So the path is resolved ONCE, here, with the same parser the proxy uses, and
 * both read the result.
 *
 * `new URL` collapses `.` and `..` INCLUDING their percent-encoded forms —
 * `%2e%2e` and `%2E%2E` resolve exactly like `..` (checked against this Node,
 * not assumed). So for those the resolved path is already the one the proxy
 * will use, and there is nothing to refuse.
 *
 * What it does NOT collapse is a dot segment hidden behind an ENCODED SLASH.
 * `/api/trade/..%2fidentity/x` and `/api/trade/%2f../identity/x` survive
 * verbatim, because `%2f` hides the segment boundary from the parser. Whether
 * that becomes a path separator is then the upstream's decision and not ours —
 * the same disagreement as before, moved one layer down. So the path is decoded
 * once more and re-inspected: a dot segment that appears only after decoding
 * means the edge and the upstream cannot be made to agree, and a request nobody
 * can route to one place does not get to pick.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT refused: a segment that merely decodes to contain a slash,
 * such as `/api/v1/orders/BTC%2FUSDT`. That is an ordinary CCXT symbol, and the
 * cancel paths in `ALWAYS_ALLOWED_REST` are the release routes that let users
 * out during an incident — breaking those would be worse than the bug this
 * closes. Only a decoded DOT SEGMENT is refused.
