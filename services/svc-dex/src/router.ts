/**
 * svc-dex — the Protocol Plane's front door (§17.5).
 *
 * **Every procedure here is permissionless.** No login, no KYC tier, no account
 * gate beyond a wallet. That is not a relaxation, it is §503:
 *
 *   "No-KYC exists on the Protocol Plane because there is nothing to KYC — the
 *    platform never holds user assets there."
 *
 * `publicJurisdictionProcedure('dex', 'protocol')` still runs the jurisdiction
 * matrix, because a sanctioned region is a legal constraint rather than a
 * custody one. `checkAccess` short-circuits a `custodial: false` module on the
 * protocol plane to `allowed.permissionless` before any tier is read — so the
 * gate that remains is the one that must, and the one that must not is gone.
 *
 * Contrast svc-trade, the custodial venue: `scopedProcedure('trade:write')`
 * with `minTier: 'basic'`, because that service holds the user's balance. Same
 * platform, two planes, and the difference is visible in one line of each
 * router.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * `quote` USED TO BE A CALCULATOR. IT IS NOW A QUOTE.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * It previously took `quotes: []` over the wire and routed whatever the CALLER
 * supplied. The arithmetic was real and tested; the prices came from nowhere.
 * Anything rendering that result showed a user a number no venue had ever
 * offered — and a user who acts on such a number has been misled by us.
 *
 * So `quote` now sources its own prices from live venues, enforces
 * `QUOTE_MAX_AGE_MS` on them, and REFUSES when it cannot. The old behaviour
 * survives under a name that cannot be mistaken for a price — `routePreview` —
 * because the arithmetic is genuinely useful for showing how routing works, and
 * because leaving it called `quote` was the actual defect.
