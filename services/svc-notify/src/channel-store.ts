 *                     is no single column that would let it.

 * by hand. An operator who raises `NOTIFY_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_MS` to its 30s ceiling

 * `pending` forever — the exact lie the sweep exists to remove, reached through
 * a different door (closeout: LANE-CLOSEOUT-OPS-2026-08-08).
 *
 * Bound: bus default `maxDeliver` (5) × `ack_wait` (30s) = 150s. After the
 * lease has been dead that long, the bus cannot still be retrying in a way that
 * would reclaim the row — any redelivery that was coming would already have
 * arrived and reclaimed. Waiting that window is how we know nobody is coming
 * back, without throwing away a retry the user is still owed.
 *
 * Paired with `DEFAULT_CLAIM_LEASE_MS` / the configured lease: a live lease is

   *
   * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SWEEP AND NOT ONLY INSIDE `claim`
   *
   * `abandoned` used to be written in exactly one place: the retire branch of
   * `claim`, reached when a LATER bus redelivery finds the row out of attempts.
   * That branch depends on there being a later redelivery, and there is not
   * always one. `max_deliver` is 5 and `NOTIFY_MAX_DELIVERY_ATTEMPTS` may be
   * configured up to 5 — the README's env table says "1–5, at or below the bus
   * maxDeliver" — so the delivery that spends the last attempt can be the same
   * one JetStream then parks. No sixth message arrives, `claim` is never called
   * again for that pair, and the row stays `pending` forever.
   *
   * README: "After NOTIFY_MAX_DELIVERY_ATTEMPTS the row is `abandoned` rather
   * than left looking like it is still being retried." `notify.deliveries` is
   * user-facing on purpose — a margin call's own recipient reads it — so a row
   * that says `pending` while nothing is retrying it is the service telling the
   * person whose collateral is at risk that help is still on the way.
   *
   * TWO ARMS (either is enough to retire)
   *
   *   1. Attempts-ceiling (what `claim` would retire on a later redelivery):
   *      `attempts >= maxAttempts` AND (settled `failed`, or `pending` with no
   *      live lease).
   *
   *   2. Stuck-pending with a dead lease past the bus redelivery window:
   *      `status = pending`, at least one claim was taken, lease is null or
   *      expired, and the lease has been dead longer than `STUCK_PENDING_GRACE_MS`
   *      (bus maxDeliver × ack_wait). This closes the hole where `in_flight`
   *      naks burn `max_deliver` without raising `attempts`, so arm 1 never
   *      fires — see `STUCK_PENDING_GRACE_MS`.
   *
   * A live lease is never touched. That row has an owner who is about to settle
   * it, possibly as `accepted`.
   *
   * Returns the number of rows retired. Never sends, never acks, never writes
   * `accepted_at`: this only ever moves a row from "still being tried" to the
   * truth, which is that it is over.
