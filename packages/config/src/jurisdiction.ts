/**
 * JURISDICTION_MATRIX (§3, §9, §22).
 *
 * The single place geo rules live. Every module checks the matrix; launch
 * markets are a toggle, not a refactor.
 *
 * §22 THE SOVEREIGNTY LAW — encoded in `checkAccess`:
 *   custody === false  → permissionless. No KYC gate. The platform never holds
 *                        the asset, so there is nothing to verify.
 *   custody === true   → tiered verification per this matrix.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * OPERATOR NOTE — the seed entries below are a STRUCTURE, not legal advice.
 * Every `status` and `minTier` value must be signed off by counsel for the
 * relevant jurisdiction before that market is switched on. `reviewedBy` and
 * `reviewedAt` are required on any rule that ships to prod; `assertReviewed()`
 * is called by the DoD gate for launch markets.
 *
 * THE SANCTIONS BLOCKLIST IS EMPTY, ON PURPOSE, AND STILL NEEDS COUNSEL.
 * No list ships configured. What changed is that the empty state is no longer
 * invisible: every decision reports whether a list was consulted
 * (`AccessDecision.screening`), and `assertScreeningConfigured()` refuses to let
 * a production-like process boot without one. See `screening.ts` for the shape
 * counsel's answer goes into — supplying it is a config change, not an
 * engineering project.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS FILE IS BUSINESS CONFIGURATION. IT IS NOT THE SANCTIONS AUTHORITY.
 *
 * Everything in `JURISDICTION_MATRIX` — `status`, `minTier`, `limitMultiplier`,
 * and `blocked` — is business configuration: which markets we open, at what
 * tier, with what limits. It is edited by ordinary contributors in ordinary PRs
 * for licensing, commercial and product reasons.
 *
 * The sanctions screening list is a DIFFERENT authority with a DIFFERENT owner
 * (counsel, per DIRECTION §8) and it lives in `screening.ts`, supplied as
 * configuration at deploy time.
 *
 * They used to be able to satisfy each other. A `blocked: true` entry here was
 * folded into a `ScreeningList` and merged with the counsel-supplied one, so
 * ONE region blocked for a commercial reason flipped `assertScreeningConfigured`
 * from "refuse to start" to "satisfied" while the sanctions list was still empty
 * and nobody in counsel had supplied anything. Two authorities sharing one
 * literal, and the weaker one silently vouching for the stronger.
 *
 * They are separated now, and the separation runs both ways:
 *
 *   · A `blocked: true` entry here STILL REFUSES THE REGION. Nothing about the
 *     existing refusal is weakened — see `businessBlockFor` and `checkAccess`.
 *   · It CANNOT satisfy the screening guard. Only `screening.ts` can.
 *   · Every refusal records WHICH authority refused (`AccessDecision.blockedBy`),
 *     so a legal control and a commercial one are never read as the same thing.
 *
 * Where the two cannot be told apart — a `blocked: true` entry whose reason
 * nobody wrote down — the ambiguous case refuses in both directions: the region
 * stays blocked, and the boot guard stays unsatisfied.

 * cannot fail is worth less than no test, because it is read as evidence.
