/**
 * DOES THE OPERATOR CONSOLE TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT IS OFF?
 *
 * ── The finding ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `LAUNCH_DROP` defaults to `0`, so `FLAG_REGISTRY` resolves all but five flags
 * off. Nothing under `services/*` resolves a flag — there is not one import of
 * `isEnabled` / `resolveAll` / `FLAG_REGISTRY` in any service — so those
 * capabilities answered every request. This board rendered a `Dark` chip and a
 * switch for each of them, and an operator cannot distinguish "the registry says
 * off" from "the capability is off" unless a page says which it means.
 *
 * We did NOT resolve this by gating at the edge. See the branch's commit
 * message: at `LAUNCH_DROP=0` every routed module's flags are off, so a
 * flag-consulting perimeter would refuse the entire platform — including
 * `edge.gateway` itself, which is drop I. The launch flags are a plan; the
 * enforced perimeter control is the module kill-switch, which is separate,
 * live, and unchanged by this branch.
 *
 * ── Why these assertions are on markup ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The bug was in what an operator READ. `renderToStaticMarkup` produces exactly
 * the string a browser was served, so every assertion below is against the
 * artefact that misled someone — not against a comment claiming it will not
 * happen again, and not against a helper that the render is free to ignore.
 *
 * The negative assertions carry the weight. "The word `Dark` does not appear in
 * the `protocol.amm` row" fails the moment someone reintroduces a capability
 * claim, however they spell the component that makes it.
