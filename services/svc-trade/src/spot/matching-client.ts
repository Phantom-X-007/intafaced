/**
 * THE ENGINE, AS SEEN FROM HERE (§5.1 / §5.2).
 *
 * svc-matching is a separate service with its own process, its own journal and
 * its own tests. §15.2 forbids reaching into it: cross-service work goes over
 * an interface, never over an import of the other service's source. So this
 * file declares the narrow port svc-trade needs and an HTTP implementation of
 * it, shaped exactly to the routes svc-matching's README publishes.
 *
 * EVERY AMOUNT HERE IS A DECIMAL STRING. That is the engine's wire format and
 * it is not negotiable — a JSON number would round the 18th decimal place away
 * silently, and the 18th decimal place is where a book stops reconciling. The
 * strings are parsed into `Amount` the moment they cross into `trade-service.ts`
 * and never travel further as strings.
 *
 * What this port exposes for money-safe recovery: submit, cancel, native
 * amend (PATCH), mass-cancel by account owner, depth, the non-destructive
 * live-order list (GET), and scheduled reconcile. It does not import matching
 * source (§15.2). Mass-cancel owner is accountId. Session is not a field —
 * this client never sends one.
