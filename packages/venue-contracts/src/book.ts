/**
 * THE SEQUENCED BOOK CONTRACT.
 *
 * ── The failure this shape exists to make impossible ────────────────────────
 *
 * A websocket depth stream that silently drops one update leaves a book that
 * answers every question instantly, renders perfectly, and is WRONG. There is
 * no symptom. No exception, no gap in a log, no latency spike — just a price
 * that was never on the venue, handed to a router that trusts it. The first
 * anyone knows is a fill at a level nobody was offering.
 *
 * The only defence is arithmetic: the venue numbers its updates, and we check
 * that the numbers are contiguous before we believe them. That check has to be
 * mandatory, not advisory, which is why `sequence` below is not optional and
 * why `sequenced` is a field a consumer can branch on rather than something to
 * be inferred from a zero.
 *
 * ── Why `sequenced: false` is honest rather than a loophole ─────────────────
 *
 * Some venues genuinely publish no sequence — an AMM read at a block height,
 * an OTC desk quoting on request. A book from one of those cannot be gap-
 * checked, and pretending otherwise by generating a counter of our own would be
 * the worst outcome available: a consumer would believe it could detect a gap
 * on a feed that gives it no way to. So the field says which it is, and a
 * consumer that requires gap detection filters on it.
 *
 * ── Absolute levels, always ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A delta carries the NEW TOTAL at a price, never a change to it, and quantity
 * zero is the only encoding of removal. Both learned the hard way by every
 * exchange that did it the other way — see `packages/market-data/src/depth.ts`,
 * which is this repo's prior art and which the fabric's tracker delegates to
 * rather than reimplementing.
