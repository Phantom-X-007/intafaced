/**
 * THE REAL EVM `ChainSource` — SOCKET §13 `socket.evm-rpc`, closed here.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS STILL A SOCKET
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * REAL: everything in this file. It walks a chain over a real JSON-RPC endpoint,
 * reads real block hashes and real parent hashes, pulls real logs, and hands the
 * ingest loop blocks that link. The reorg machinery downstream was written
 * against `MemoryChainSource`, whose hashes this repository computes itself —
 * which proves the projection matches the design, and proves nothing about
 * whether the design survives an EVM. It does now: `evm/reorg.live.test.ts`
 * forks a real chain and asserts the orphaned rows are gone.
 *
 * STILL A SOCKET: the ABI. No audited production venue emits the three events in
 * `abi.ts` — `contracts/dev/DevVenue.sol` is a test fixture and says so.
 * `socket.clob-contracts` is that gap, and it is a contracts problem, not an
 * indexer one. This adapter does not depend on which events it decodes: swap the
 * ABI and every line below is unchanged.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A `PublicClient` and nothing else. There is no `WalletClient` in this service,
 * no key in `env.ts`, and no function on `venueAbi` that changes state — the ABI
 * carries three events and zero functions, so there is nothing here to call even
 * by accident (§16.10). `sovereignty.test.ts` asserts all of that over the
 * shipped tree on every run.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE THREE DECISIONS WORTH READING
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── 1. Logs are fetched BY BLOCK HASH, never by block number ────────────────
 *
 * `eth_getLogs({ blockHash })`, not `{ fromBlock, toBlock }`. This is the single
 * most important line in the file.
 *
 * Reading a header at height N and then asking for the logs *at height N* is two
 * questions about "height N", and between them the chain can reorg. The node
 * answers both, correctly, about two different blocks — and the adapter staples
 * branch B's logs onto branch A's header. The result is a block that never
 * existed, carrying a hash that says it did, and the projection records it as
 * canonical. No error, no gap, nothing to detect it by afterwards, because the
 * provenance the whole read model relies on is now a lie.
 *
 * Asking by hash cannot do that. The hash names one block; if that block is gone
 * the node says so and the height is simply retried.
 *
 * ── 2. A failure NEVER comes back as `null` ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ChainSource.head()` uses `null` for "this source has no chain to report", and
 * the ingest loop reads that as *nothing to do* — idle, no error, no halt. That
 * is right for `NullChainSource`. For an RPC adapter it would be a disaster: an
 * indexer pointed at a dead endpoint would be indistinguishable from one that was
 * never given a chain, the cursor would stop moving without saying why, and
 * `book` would keep serving its last projection as though it were current.
 *
 * So this class throws `ChainUnavailableError` with a code. `Indexer` records it
 * on `lastError` and `status` publishes it beside the cursor it explains.
 * `null` from here means exactly one thing: the chain answered, and there is no
 * block at that height yet.
 *
 * ── 3. The venue's code is re-read on every pass ────────────────────────────
 *
 * `eth_getLogs` against an address with no contract on it returns `[]`. Not an
 * error — a perfectly formed empty answer, forever. Project that and every read
 * reports an empty book, confidently, about a market that may be busy. It is the
 * `suiteDeployed` lesson from #210 in its most dangerous form: there, a missing
 * contract made a read fail; here it makes a read succeed with nothing in it.
 *
 * `#verifyVenue` is therefore an actual `eth_getCode` on every `head()`, not a
 * boolean memoised at boot. The dev chain holds no volume, so a `docker compose
 * restart evm` genuinely removes the contract while leaving the endpoint up and
 * the chain id unchanged — the exact shape that a boot-time check misses.
