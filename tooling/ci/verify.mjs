/**
 * `pnpm verify` — the same steps as before, plus a verdict that cannot be
 * skipped past.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A `&&` CHAIN ANY MORE
 *
 * The chain was:
 *
 *   scan:agent-autoload && tracker:check && format:check &&
 *   turbo run build typecheck test && scan:workspace && dod-gate
 *
 * Two properties of `&&` are what this replaces:
 *
 *  1. **The last link never runs when an earlier one fails.** `pnpm verify` halts
 *     turbo on the first failing task, so a red `svc-trade` means the run never
 *     reaches `svc-pay` at all — and that is exactly the moment someone needs to
 *     be told how much of the suite was real. Several agents have been reaching
 *     for `--continue` to get that picture by hand. The verdict now prints
 *     unconditionally, pass or fail, and `pnpm verify --continue` forwards the
 *     flag to turbo for anyone who wants the whole board.
 *
 *  2. **`;` is not portable.** pnpm runs scripts through the platform shell, so
 *     an "always run this last" link written with `;` works on a developer's
 *     bash and silently changes meaning on Windows. A node script behaves the
 *     same everywhere, which for a repo whose agents run on three platforms is
 *     the difference between a rule and a suggestion.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not change which steps run, their order, or the exit code you get for
 * a genuine failure. `pnpm verify` still exits non-zero on the first broken
 * step; a run whose only problem is unreachable infrastructure still exits 0 on
 * a developer machine, because a `verify` that cannot be run without Docker is a
 * `verify` that gets deleted. What it adds is that such a run can no longer end
 * on the word "successful" without a paragraph underneath explaining what that
 * word is not covering.
