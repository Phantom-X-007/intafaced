# Compaction readiness audit — frontend implement chat · 2026-07-31

**Question:** Did compaction cost quality, plan completeness, or operator control?  
**Answer in one line:** **Planning was compaction-ready; live ship state was only partly synced to SoT — code/P21 survived, the “where we are” page lagged.**

---

## 1 · What you meant (spoken + unspoken)

| Spoken | Unspoken need (inferred) |
| --- | --- |
| “Did we suffer context loss?” | Prove nothing important only lived in chat memory |
| “I planned for compactions” | Confirm the SoT chain actually works as the resume law |
| “No compromise whatsoever” | Adversarial check — not comfort — on quality and completeness |
| (implied) keep moving | After audit, rehydrate next moves without him re-teaching |

**Success condition for “ready”:** a cold agent + disk only can continue without inventing status, re-opening planning, or dropping a human decision.

---

## 2 · Compaction readiness grade

| Layer | Ready? | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Planning / law** | **Yes** | Locked chain on disk: STATE-OF-TRUTH · methodology · master plan · Design Bar · claim · handoff paste |
| **Wave A product code** | **Yes (on branch)** | `#267` `feat/app-wave-a-continue` holds honesty stack + P21 commit `3859dc5` |
| **Operator “live status” page** | **Partial fail** | Main `FRONTEND-STATE-OF-TRUTH` still says styleboard residual pick; no P21 line; sequence still “Style → you pick” |
| **Handoff paste for NEW chat** | **Stale for mid-ship** | Still cold-start “go implement / N1–N4 pick” — correct for zero, wrong for post-P21 continue |
| **Color decision durability** | **On PR only** | `COLOR-LOCK-P21…` + token apply live on worktree/PR; **not** mirrored into main checkout operator SoT until this audit |
| **Visual proof of P21 on shell** | **Not proven post-lock** | Palette board shots exist; **no verified Orca of live :8090 after teal apply** this session |
| **Merge / tip hygiene** | **At risk** | PR #267 `mergeable: CONFLICTING`; branch ~15 commits behind `origin/main` (main moved: pay/futures/identity/docs) |
| **CI signal on #267** | **Weak** | `gh pr checks` reported no checks on head at audit time |

**Verdict on your plan:** You **were ready for planning compaction**. This compact hit **mid-implementation after a color pick** — that layer depended more on PR/worktree truth than on the operator SoT page. **Not a total hit off-guard**, but **not zero drift**.

---

## 3 · What did **not** get lost (verified this turn)

| Claim | Verification |
| --- | --- |
| P21 pick + modular intent | Tokens in worktree `intafaced.css` = P21 hex; lock doc on branch; brand orange hex remapped (~54 source files + SVGs) |
| Wave A stack on #267 | PR open; commits include withdraw A2′, uc A1′, growth honesty, locks, grouping, OTC, styleboards, **P21** |
| #261 / #262 | **MERGED** to main |
| Live lane claim | `docs/LIVE-LANES.md` still lists frontend-wave-a → #261 #262 #267 shipping |
| Free-hands / orange not sacred | Design Bar on branch updated; methodology still free-hands |
| Green/red = market only | P21 lock + retheme leave up/down as market colors |
| Worktree discipline | Active path `.worktrees/feat-app-wave-a-continue` — not main checkout for shell edits |

---

## 4 · Real gaps (quality / completeness) — not “memory fog”

These are **material**, not cosmetic:

### G1 — Operator SoT lag (compaction hole)

- Main `docs/FRONTEND-STATE-OF-TRUTH-2026-07-31.md` still: Styleboard = N1–N4 pick open; progress ends at “styleboard draft”.
- Reality: color-only path P01–P36 → **P21 provisional lock applied + pushed**.
- Gap-audit residual still says **“Nitro pick”** after he already picked.

**Risk if ignored:** next chat re-asks style or restarts styleboard theater.

### G2 — Decision path evolved; plan table did not fully absorb it

Plan §4 still frames **N1–N4 full systems**. You correctly rejected vibe boards and locked **color first (P21)**. That is valid free-hands. **Not written as the new lock on the operator page** until post-audit patch.

**Risk:** agent “completeness” thinks N3 dual-tone system is still the open gate for Wave B, when you already authorized color-now / system-later modular path.

### G3 — #267 merge conflict with moving main

Main absorbed #261/#262 and ~13 other tips while #267 grew. **Stack must rebase/restack before merge** or quality of “done” is fake.

### G4 — P21 not yet eyes-proven on live shell

Token ship ≠ “I saw teal desk on :8090.” Prior Orca pain (black margins / wrong scroll) still in history. **Unverified for P21 product surface.**

### G5 — Dual home for docs

- Many frontend SoT files live **local main `docs/`** (often untracked vs GitHub).
- P21 lock lived **only on feature branch** until operator mirror.
- Handoff warned: “many not yet on GitHub.” That is still the durability weak link for machine switch — separate from chat compaction but same failure class.

### G6 — Name debt known (not a loss)

`--ix-orange*` **names** hold **teal values**. Documented. Fine for modularity; do not “fix” by renaming mid-ship unless cleanup PR.

### G7 — Session / START-HERE altitude

Still #86-era orange rebrand language in places. Not wrong historically; **can mislead a cold agent** that orange is still the product brand.

## 5 · Compaction impact matrix

| Area | Compromised? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Doctrine / money rules | No | Unrelated; still absolute |
| Wave A honesty code | No | On branch + earlier merges |
| Color pick P21 | No code loss | Applied + committed + pushed |
| Plan completeness (agent next step) | **Yes, mild** | Next step list still “pick style” in SoT/gap-audit |
| Quality of ship claim | **Yes, mild** | Conflict + no post-P21 Orca |
| Your control surface | **Yes, mild** | You would not see P21 as “done” on SoT without this audit |
| Ambition / free-hands | No | Not shrunk by compact |

**Nothing catastrophic was deleted from product code by compaction.**  
**Completeness of the operating picture was the weak surface.**

---

## 6 · Were you ready? (straight answer)

| If compaction hit… | Ready? |
| --- | --- |
| After planning lock, before implement | **Yes** — handoff + SoT design is correct |
| Mid Wave A code (honesty) | **Mostly** — PR/worktree + gap-audit carry the stack |
| **Right after color pick / retheme (this hit)** | **Half** — code durable; **operator SoT + proof + merge hygiene** not updated in lockstep |

You planned for **transcript death**. You did **not** fully plan for **“status page always one step behind last ship”** under continuous implement. That is the only structural miss.

---

## 7 · Restored truth (post-audit)

| Fact | Now |
| --- | --- |
| Color | **P21 provisional** — modular; changeable later |
| Full N1–N4 system | **Not** final-picked; color first is enough to stop style theater and allow Wave B craft on tokens |
| Wave A | Largely stacked on #267; A2′/A1′ on main via #261/#262 |
| Next engineering (no new human pick required) | Restack #267 on tip main · CI · Orca P21 desk proof · then Wave B craft / residual honesty |
| Human only | Re-pick palette id if taste changes; rare product forks |

---

## 8 · Completeness checklist (agent must keep true)

After any material ship **before** another compact risk:

1. Update **STATE-OF-TRUTH** implement progress + locked decisions  
2. Update **gap-audit** residuals  
3. COLOR / style locks in a **named doc** + token file  
4. PR link + mergeability known  
5. Proof status explicit: verified / unverified  
6. LIVE-LANES still owns the lane  
7. Handoff paste: either “cold start” **or** “mid-ship continue” section — not only cold

---

## 9 · Immediate next moves (no re-planning)

1. Patch SoT + gap-audit + handoff mid-ship (this audit’s follow-on)  
2. Rebase/restack `feat/app-wave-a-continue` onto `origin/main`; resolve conflicts  
3. Boot shell · Orca prove P21 on exchange + one money surface  
4. CI green on #267  
5. Resume Wave B craft (tokens already P21) without reopening style marathon

*Audit method: disk + git + `gh pr` this turn; not chat memory. Claim tags: verified vs residual called out above.*
