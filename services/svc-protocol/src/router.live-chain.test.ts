/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE FOUR PROCEDURES THAT HAVE NEVER RETURNED A VALUE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `predictAddress`, `buildDeployment`, `sessionStatus`, `claimAccount`.
 *
 * Every existing test of these either stubs the chain (`router.mount.test.ts`
 * supplies `isDeployed: async () => false`, which is a plausible answer nobody
 * read from anywhere) or asserts the refusal. Both are correct and neither
 * demonstrates the happy path, because until now there was no chain to have one
 * on. `PROTOCOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS` was `0x0`, so `predictAddress` refused before
 * it did any arithmetic at all.
 *
 * This file wires the REAL `ProtocolChain` — the same class `index.ts` builds —
 * to a real anvil, deploys the real factory, and drives the real router. The
 * only things faked are the ones that are not chain state: the registry's
 * storage (`MemoryAccountStore`, as `registry.test.ts` already uses) and the
 * edge principal, which is signed for real with a test secret.
 *
 * Skips without a chain, hard-fails on CI where `REQUIRE_EVM_CHAIN=1`.
 * `router.mount.test.ts` is what proves the refusals still hold when it is
 * absent, and `chain/refusal-without-chain.test.ts` proves it against a real
 * dead socket rather than a stub.
