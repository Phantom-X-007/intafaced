 * Escrowed value lives in the ledger's `escrow` account kind, put there by
 * `escrowLock` and taken out by exactly one of `escrowRelease` / `escrowRefund`.
 * These tables hold the *terms* and the *decisions* — never the money.
 *
 * Which means the interesting column in this file is `p2p_trades.resolution`.
 * It is the recorded decision, written and committed BEFORE the ledger post
 * that acts on it. One row, one resolution, immutable once set: that is what
 * makes "released to both parties" impossible rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * 100+ fiat currencies are `packages/config/src/fiat.ts`, not a table here
 * (§6.2: "config, not code"). `fiat_currency` is a plain ISO-4217 code
 * validated against that registry at the edge.
