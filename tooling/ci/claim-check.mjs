/**
 * CLAIM CHECK — is anyone already inside the files you are about to edit?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `docs/LIVE-LANES.md` records who owns which MOUNTAIN. That
 * is the right granularity for deciding who builds Pay OS and who builds the
 * trader shell, and it is the wrong granularity for the thing that actually
 * costs us: two people editing the same file on the same afternoon.
 *
 * A concrete example, and the reason this file exists. An agent was dispatched
 * to migrate test isolation in `services/svc-pay`. Lane ownership said Pay was
 * a human mountain, which it read as "do not build pay FEATURES" — and test
 * infrastructure is not a feature, so it proceeded. Meanwhile PR #346 was open
 * and editing `services/svc-pay/src/payment-service.test.ts`: the exact file.
 *
 * Nobody was careless. The board answered the question it was designed to
 * answer. It simply does not carry the information "this file is open on
 * someone's desk right now", and no amount of reading it more carefully would
 * have produced that.
 *
 * The consequence would have been a merge race on test files that TRUNCATE
 * tables — which is the single worst place in this repo to have one, since the
 * losing side's rows vanish mid-assertion and it presents as flakiness.
 *
 * So: ask GitHub what is actually open, and compare it against what you are
 * about to touch. Ten seconds, no judgement required.
 *
 *   pnpm claim:check services/svc-bank    # preferred — paths you are about to edit
 *   pnpm claim:check                      # this branch vs open PRs (exit 2 if clean / no paths)
 *   node tooling/ci/claim-check.mjs --self-test   # hermetic fixtures, no gh/network
 *
 * Exit 0 = clear on the path axis (may still warn if ownership map is incomplete).
 * Exit 1 = open-PR collision or human-claimed mountain — talk before editing.
 * Exit 2 = cannot answer (blank args, clean branch, gh/git failure, list/files cap).
 *
 * This is ADVISORY, deliberately. It is not wired into `verify` and it does not
 * gate a merge. A tool that blocks people gets routed around; a tool that
 * answers a question honestly in ten seconds gets used. Overlap is often
 * completely fine — two people can edit one file with a word between them. The
 * failure mode we are removing is not overlap, it is *unknowing* overlap.
 *
 * Sealed pack on tip (#1414): blank argv refuse · rename porcelain · PR list
 * cap · per-PR files page cap · unmapped-owner honesty. Self-test pins those
 * so a quiet revert cannot re-land a false clear (W7 L09 residual).
