 * WHAT ACTUALLY REFUSES WHEN THIS FLAG IS OFF.
 *
 * ── Why this field exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `isEnabled()` answers a question about the REGISTRY. For most of this file's
 * life the admin console read that answer and rendered it as a question about
 * the PLATFORM — "protocol.amm: Dark" — and those are not the same question.
 * No file under `services/*` imports `isEnabled`, `resolveAll` or
 * `FLAG_REGISTRY`. Nothing resolves a flag on a request path. So at
 * `LAUNCH_DROP=0` (the default in `env.ts`) the console reported
 * `academy.inviteLobbies`, `protocol.amm` and `edge.gateway` as off while every
 * one of those procedures answered normally.
 *
 * That is the mirror image of the bug `svc-edge/src/routes.ts` was written to
 * prevent. There, a service was reachable that the route table did not know
 * about. Here, an operator believes a capability is off and it is answering.
 * Both are the map disagreeing with the territory; this one points at the
 * operator, which is the worse direction.
 *
 * The seven flags below that DO bite are bitten by a **separate boolean**: a
 * per-service environment variable, read once at boot, with its own default of
 * `true`, that mirrors the flag by name and nothing else. `TRADE_SPOT_ENABLED`
 * does not consult `LAUNCH_DROP`, this registry, or the flag's `drop`. So even
 * for those, "the drop clock says off" and "the capability refuses" are two
 * independent facts that happen to share a spelling.
 *
 * Stating enforcement here, as required data, makes both impossible to hide:
 * the type will not let a new flag be declared without answering "what refuses
 * when this is off?", and `flag-enforcement.test.ts` re-derives the answer from
 * the services' own `env.ts` files rather than trusting the sentence.
