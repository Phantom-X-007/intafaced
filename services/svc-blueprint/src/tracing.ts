/**
 * Tracing (§9, §14 DoD).
 *
 * svc-blueprint moves no value, so nothing here is tagged
 * `intafaced.money_path` — that flag exists to make the collector's tail
 * sampler keep money traces at 100%, and marking a non-money service with it
 * would dilute exactly the signal it protects.
 *
 * What this service traces instead is the **onboarding budget**. §7.2's exit
 * criterion is a number — "signup → session → reveal → crew placement < 3
 * minutes" — and a number in a spec that nothing measures is a wish. Every span
 * here carries `intafaced.stage`, so the p95 of each stage is a dashboard panel
 * and a regression in the engine call is visible before it is a missed target.
 *
 * ── The rule that matters more than any of that ─────────────────────────────
 * **No profile content ever reaches a span.** Not an axis, not a guardrail, not
 * a curriculum path, and above all not a session response or birth data. A span
 * attribute is exported to a collector, retained, and searchable — which makes
 * it a copy of the data outside the isolation §10 requires. `BlueprintSpanAttributes`
 * is a closed type for that reason: adding a field to it is a deliberate act,
 * visible in a diff, and not something a caller can do by passing an extra key.
