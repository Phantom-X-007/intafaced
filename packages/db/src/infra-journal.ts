/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE INFRA JOURNAL — a skipped suite has to leave a mark
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT
 *
 * An agent ran `pnpm verify` three times. Run 2 printed:
 *
 *     Tasks:    92 successful, 92 total
 *
 * and meant nothing. Postgres had saturated under parallel load, the two-second
 * connect probe in `postgresAvailable` timed out, and every database-backed
 * suite took its `describe.skip` branch. Fourteen suites did not execute. Turbo
 * counted fourteen successes, because from turbo's side of the process boundary
 * a vitest run with zero assertions and a vitest run that proved the ledger
 * balances are the same event: exit code 0.
 *
 * That number was *true*. `pnpm verify` did run 92 tasks and none of them
 * failed. It was also useless, and worse than useless, because it is the sentence
 * a human reads and stops reading. Several agents lost a day to it this week.
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY THAT MADE IT DANGEROUS
 *
 * A run gets GREENER as the machine gets more loaded. Contention makes the probe
 * time out; a timed-out probe skips; a skipped suite cannot fail. So the exact
 * conditions under which you most want the tests to run are the conditions under
 * which they quietly do not, and nothing anywhere in the output says so.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST FAIL
 *
 * Because the skip guards are right. A developer with no Docker must still be
 * able to run `pnpm verify` and get value from the 800-odd tests that need no
 * infrastructure. A gate that makes `verify` unrunnable on a laptop gets
 * reverted within a day, and then we have neither the tests nor the honesty.
 *
 * So the fix is not "fail". The fix is that **skipping stops being invisible**.
 * Every probe for an external dependency writes one line here, whichever way it
 * went, and `tooling/ci/infra-verdict.mjs` turns those lines into a verdict that
 * is printed after turbo's summary and contradicts it in plain English when the
 * run did not actually execute.
 *
 * WHY A FILE AND NOT A REPORTER
 *
 * Every package runs its own `vitest run` in its own process, under turbo, in
 * parallel, with no shared config file to hang a reporter on. A directory of
 * one-record files needs no coordination, no locking, no config in twenty
 * packages, and survives a worker being killed. `test` is `"cache": false` in
 * turbo.json, so the journal can never be replayed from a cache and go stale.
