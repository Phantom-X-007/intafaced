/**
 * svc-academy — live lobbies with capacity tiers (§8.3, §XIII).
 *
 * Phase 5. No ledger client and no LEDGER_URL: `academy` is `custodial: false`
 * and there is no credential in this process that could reach anything which
 * moves value.
 *
 * ONE PUBLISH, NO SUBSCRIBE. This header used to say "NO BUS CONNECTION
 * either", and the reason it gave was exact: the §8.3 event this service would
 * eventually emit is `intafaced.identity.xp.earned` on certification, and
 * connecting to NATS to publish nothing would add a boot dependency that can
 * fail in exchange for no capability at all. Certification has now shipped
 * (`certs/`), so there is a capability, and the connection buys it.
 *
 * The boot-dependency objection still stands, and is answered rather than
 * ignored: the connect is attempted, and a failure DEGRADES rather than kills.
 * Seats, presence, the 2D scene, the curriculum catalog and paper drills have
 * nothing to do with NATS, and taking svc-academy out of the fleet because a
 * cert award could not be published would trade the whole service for one
 * downstream side effect. `/ready` reports `xp.usable: false` and `grantCert`
 * returns `publisher_unavailable` — the same out-loud honesty the stream
 * provider gets, for the same reason. The award itself is recoverable: it is
 * keyed on the grant, so granting again re-publishes it (certs/xp-publish.ts).
 *
 * It still subscribes to nothing. `crew-events.ts` remains unmounted — a
 * consumer is a different decision from a producer, and this one is not it.
