// ── HOW TO READ THIS FILE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two things about it are load-bearing and neither is obvious.
//
// 1. THE COMPONENT PATH IS CASE-SENSITIVE IN THE BUILD, AND NOT ON THIS DESK.
//    `require(["../pages/uc/login"])` finds `Login.vue` on Windows and macOS and
//    finds nothing in the Linux build container, where it is a hard
//    `Module not found` and the whole bundle fails. Six paths here were wrong in
//    exactly that way. Match the filename character for character.
//
// 2. `requiresAuth` IS THE ONLY AUTH GATE. It is read by the global
//    `router.beforeEach` in ../main.js, which sends a signed-out visitor to
//    /login with a `redirect` back to where they were going. Before that guard
//    existed, each screen policed itself in `created()` — so the component
//    mounted, painted an empty logged-out shell, fired a request that 401'd, and
//    only then bounced. Screens that forgot to police themselves (/chat,
//    /checkuser, /identbusiness, the whole OTC desk) simply rendered blank.
//    A route that needs a session says so HERE, once.
