 * Every mutating POST requires the header. A repeated key with an identical
 * request fingerprint returns the stored response; a repeated key with a
 * different fingerprint is a conflict — answering either way would be worse
 * than refusing.
 *
 * This is the HTTP-layer contract. Ledger / rail business keys underneath
 * stay whatever `payment-service` already uses; this store is what makes a
 * merchant retry safe before any of that runs twice.
 *
 * Ordering for Class M (same claim→put shape as crypto broadcasts):
 *   1. `claim` — exactly one concurrent caller may execute for (owner, key)
 *   2. run the handler
 *   3. `put` the response (or `abandon` on 5xx so a retry may try again)
 *
 * `MemoryRestIdempotencyStore` is single-process. Production multi-replica
 * MUST supply `PostgresRestIdempotencyStore`.

 * wide that reclaiming a LIVE handler is not a scenario anyone has to reason
 * about. If a request really has been running fifteen minutes, every proxy
 * between the merchant and us abandoned it long ago.
 *
 * The cost of being wrong in each direction is asymmetric, which is why the
 * margin is lopsided:
 *
 *   · too SHORT — two callers run the same money handler concurrently. The
 *     service layer would mostly catch it (a state transition refuses, a refund
 *     carries its own business key) but "mostly" is not a thing to rely on.
 *   · too LONG  — a merchant waits longer before a wedged key frees itself.
 *
 * So: minutes, not seconds. And the token on `put`/`abandon` means even a
 * mistaken reclaim cannot let the dead handler's response overwrite the live
 * one's row.
