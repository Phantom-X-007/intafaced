# Board Clear Execution Plan — 2026-08-01

**Binding with:** [`BOARD-CLEAR-CONSTITUTION-2026-08-01.md`](BOARD-CLEAR-CONSTITUTION-2026-08-01.md)  
**Purpose:** Spec + decompose so orchestrators execute without Nitro.  
**Rule:** No code for a row until its slice has a Done-linked ship list below (or an addendum PR updates this file first).

---

## 0. Programs (parallel ownership)

**Human hard lock (2026-08-01):** `@shehzad002` — full ship list in [`SHEHZAD-HARD-OWNERSHIP-2026-08-01.md`](SHEHZAD-HARD-OWNERSHIP-2026-08-01.md). Agents **babysit only** on H-\* programs.

Orchestrator may run **one agent per AGENT program** (or more if non-overlapping). **Never** spawn implementers for H-\* while HUMAN-CLAIMED.

## 1. Dependency graph (hard)

```
H-PROT smart-accounts (shehzad) ──► H-PROT amm (shehzad)
H-TRADE-HARD futures events (shehzad) ──► P-WS E2E (agent)
P-TRADE-LIGHT / spot money ──► P-UI trade actions truth (agent)
H-PAY card (shehzad) ──► optional P-UI pay surfaces (agent, after APIs)
P-OR #289 (agent) ──► H-OR-JAVA residual (shehzad)
```

Agent Wave A parallel on AGENT programs only. Human runs H-\* on his schedule.

---

## 3. Per-program detailed specs (minimum)

### 3.1 P-UI (web.terminal)

**Research first:** `docs/FRONTEND-STATE-OF-TRUTH-*.md`, brand locks, stream A claim; tree under **vendor shell :8090**.  
**Do not** build `apps/web` as product. Do not redesign whole app if shell works — finish gaps.  
**Ships:** hotkeys, sub-accounts, order form honesty, empty book honesty, a11y.  
**Done proof:** PR list + Orca/playwright/screenshot; tracker web.terminal → done.

### 3.2 P-WS

**Research:** existing private stream routes, event catalog `orderUpdated` `fillSettled` `positionUpdated`.  
**Ships:** subscription auth, backfill policy, position fan-out E2E.  
**Done proof:** integration test with trade publishing events.

### 3.3 H-PAY (**shehzad002 only**)

**Full ship list:** `SHEHZAD-HARD-OWNERSHIP` PAY-01…11.  
**Agents:** babysit PRs only — do not implement card recipes.

### 3.4 H-PROT (**shehzad002 only**)

**Full ship list:** PROT-01…09.  
**Agents:** babysit only.

### 3.5 Trade split

**P-TRADE-LIGHT (agent):** mm-bot recovery/reseed/mid residual; spot OHLCV; venue mount.  
**H-TRADE-HARD (shehzad002):** futures **risk** FUT-01…08; real OTC/copy/algo engines.  
**Agents must not** “thin stub” OTC/copy/algo to mark Done if human owns real engines — leave OPEN until he ships or §13.

### 3.6 P-OR (agent) then H-OR-JAVA (shehzad)

**Agent:** rebase/merge #289.  
**Human after:** Java dual-book residual ORJ-\*.

### 3.7 Phase 5 split

**H-P5-MONEY (shehzad):** bank earn/cards/ramps.  
**P-P5-LIGHT (agent):** academy / ops / agents thin or §13.

## 4. Execution loop (orchestrator forever)

```
loop until scoreboard all Done|Cut:
  1. Read CONSTITUTION + this PLAN + SCOREBOARD + origin/main tip
  2. List open campaign PRs → babysit red CI → merge green Class M/N/P
  3. Pick highest-priority unblocked ship from Wave A then B
  4. Spawn worktree + implement + verify + PR + babysit + merge
  5. Update SCOREBOARD + tracker same turn
  6. If ship needs research, spend research then ship same wave (no research-only forever)
  7. Never wait for Nitro
```

### Priority when overloaded (agent orchestrator)

1. #289 P-OR close
2. web.terminal P-UI Done (visible product)
3. P-TRADE-LIGHT (mm/spot/venue)
4. P-WS E2E (mock until human futures events)
5. P-P5-LIGHT academy/ops
6. Babysit shehzad Class M PRs
7. **Never** “help” by coding H-PAY/H-PROT/H-TRADE-HARD

---

## 5. PR standards

- Title: `type(scope): …`
- Body: what / why / how I know / money self-audit if Class M
- One service/concern
- CI green before merge
- Squash-merge; delete remote branch

---

## 6. Replan triggers (update this file)

- Main tip moves with Denon conflicts
- A Done bar proves impossible without invent → rewrite bar + §13, don’t invent
- #289 scope explosion → split ships, keep claimed
- Secret class truly absent → sandbox Done + §13 prod

---

## 7. Completeness checklist (orchestrator self-check)

Before claiming campaign finished:

- [ ] Every §3 constitution row Done or Cut+§13
- [ ] Tracker matches scoreboard
- [ ] No open Board Clear PRs red
- [ ] #289 not orphan
- [ ] Protocol has deploy proof + audit package
- [ ] Pay has card path proof
- [ ] Trade mountains each addressed
- [ ] Phase 5 each addressed
- [ ] START-HERE points here
- [ ] Autonomous run doc still accurate

If any box unchecked → **not finished — continue loop**.
