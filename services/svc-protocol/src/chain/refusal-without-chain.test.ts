/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A LOCAL DEV CHAIN MUST NOT BECOME SOMETHING PRODUCTION QUIETLY NEEDS
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The `evm` service in docker-compose.yml is dev-only, and the point of this
 * file is that its absence changes nothing about how svc-protocol behaves.
 * Stop the container, unset the env, deploy to an environment that has no
 * chain — every dependent path must still refuse with the typed code it shipped
 * with, and none of them may start answering because "there is usually a chain
 * now".
 *
 * ── Why this exists alongside router.mount.test.ts ─────────────────────────
 *
 * That suite proves the same contract with a hand-built chain stub. It is a
 * good test and it has a blind spot it names itself: a stub throws the error
 * the test author expected. This one uses the REAL `ProtocolChain`, with real
 * viem, pointed at a real TCP port with nothing listening on it — so the error
 * being classified is one the network produced, not one a test wrote down.
 *
 * That distinction is exactly where `classifyChainError` could rot: viem
 * re-wraps errors as it bubbles them through the transport, so the shape a stub
 * asserts can drift from the shape a socket actually produces on a viem
 * upgrade, and nothing would notice.
 *
 * No chain is needed to run this. That is the whole idea.
