# Decisions — 30 July 2026 (Denon / Stream B)

Board: `docs/DENON-NITRO-PARALLEL-BOARD-2026-07-30.md`. Items A1.1–A1.3, plus
A1.7 which turned out to gate everything else.

Every claim below was checked against the live repo and the running database, not
recalled. Where I am uncertain I say so.

---

## A1.7 — CI is dead, and it blocks the merge protocol. **DECIDED: merge on local gate + self-audit.**

**Evidence:** 100 consecutive runs, **zero successes**, spanning 00:32–05:24 today.
Every job fails with **zero steps executed** and no retrievable logs
(`BlobNotFound`). Actions are enabled (`{"enabled":true,"allowed_actions":"all"}`).
Runner labels are plain `ubuntu-latest`. Workflows last changed in #99, well
before the window — so this is not a workflow bug and not a code failure.

A job that fails with zero steps never reached a runner. That leaves **quota or
spending limit**.

**Local `pnpm verify` on `main` right now: 86/86 tasks, DoD gate PASSED**, with
`workspace-sync` (16 services), `brand-scan` (575 files), `custody-scan` (67
files) and `migration-check` (23 migrations, all reversible) clean. So the tree
is healthy; only the runner is not.

**Consequence for the split:** my merge authority is "green CI + self-audit", and
green CI is currently unobtainable. Rather than stall the spine, the substitute
gate is: **full local `pnpm verify` green, gates clean, plus a written money
self-audit on the PR.** Every PR I merge under this regime says so explicitly, so
the exception is auditable and reversible once CI is back.

**Needs the owner** — I cannot check billing without adding a `user` scope to
your GitHub token, which is a change to your account and not mine to make:
→ **github.com/settings/billing** (Actions minutes / spending limit).

## A1.1 — Chart licence. **DECIDED: pursue the grant, ship Apache in the meantime.**

Three products get conflated under "TradingView charts":

| product | licence | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lightweight Charts** | Apache-2.0, open source | rendering only — candles, crosshair, scales |
| **Advanced Charts** (was "Charting Library") | free of charge, **not** open source; you apply and are granted access | drawing tools, indicator library, saved layouts — what Hyperliquid uses |
| **Trading Platform** | same gating | Advanced Charts plus order-entry integration |

**What actually went wrong was never cost.** The vendored copy was **Advanced
Charts v1.11 (2017) with no licence, NOTICE, EULA or copyright anywhere across
its 85 files** — a redistributed copy inherited in the fork. Purging it (#106)
was correct on those grounds alone.

**Current state, verified:** the library is gone from disk and blocked in
`.gitignore` with the condition written into the rule. The terminal runs
lightweight-charts vendored as a standalone bundle — no npm dependency, no CDN.
`docs/TERMINAL.md` already names lightweight-charts.

**The gap is real.** The current wrapper is 255 lines: candlesticks, crosshair,
time scale. **Zero indicators, zero drawing tools.** That is not a pro terminal.

**Decision:**
1. **Apply to TradingView for Advanced Charts** — free, days not minutes, so it
   is the long-lead item and starting it costs nothing. **Owner action.**
2. **Ship lightweight-charts as the default** until a grant is on file.
3. **Close the interim gap without a licence** — SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI and
   Bollinger are all computable and renderable as additional series. Volume
   already works. That buys most of the visible gap; drawing tools are the part
   the grant actually pays for.
4. **Do not restore v1.11 even with a grant** — it is eight years old. Take a
   current release, which means rebuilding the datafeed adapter. That is known
   work, not research: the contract is documented and our market endpoints
   already serve it.

**Uncertainty stated:** TradingView's exact terms and application process may
have changed since my knowledge cutoff. Verify on tradingview.com before relying
on my summary of anything contractual.

## A1.2 — MySQL Connector/J. **DECIDED: the swap already on main is a valid path.**

**Verified on main:** `vendor/…/00_framework/pom.xml` now declares
`org.mariadb.jdbc:mariadb-java-client:2.7.12`, with the comment
`LGPL-2.1 — replaces GPL mysql-connector-java:8.0.11`.

The original problem: `mysql-connector-java:8.0.11` is **GPL v2 with the FOSS
exception**, and a proprietary product is not on that exception's list.

**MariaDB Connector/J is LGPL-2.1, and that is acceptable here** on the standard
analysis: a JDBC driver is loaded dynamically as a separate, unmodified jar, which
is exactly the linking case LGPL permits inside proprietary software. **The
conditions we must keep true:**

- the driver stays an **unmodified** upstream jar — do not patch it and ship it
- it stays **separately replaceable** (a normal Maven dependency, not shaded or
  vendored into our own artefact)
- it is **attributed** in `NOTICE` with its licence

If any of those three stop being true, the analysis stops holding. Shading it
into a fat jar is the realistic way that happens by accident.

**This is an engineering record, not legal advice.** LGPL linking is settled
enough in practice that I am comfortable recording it as decided; if you want it
counsel-confirmed, it is a cheap question to ask.

## A1.3 — `feat/multi-asset-instruments`. **ALREADY MERGED. The branch is superseded.**

The board reserves this as "Denon-only money-enum merge". **It has already
landed** — both halves. Verified against the running database, not the diff:

| evidence | state |
| --- | --- |
| `services/svc-trade/drizzle/0001_multi_asset_instruments.sql` | on `main` |
| `trade.markets.asset_class` distinct values | `crypto`, `commodity`, `forex` |
| `services/svc-ledger/drizzle/0003_commodity_asset_kind.sql` | on `main` |
| `ledger.asset_kind` enum | `crypto`, `fiat`, `native`, **`commodity`** |
| `ledger.assets` by kind | crypto 4, fiat 7, native 1, **commodity 5** |
| `/api/v1/markets` through the edge | returns `AUD/USD` in CCXT shape |

**So the money-enum call reserved for the owner was taken by whoever merged it.**
I am flagging that rather than quietly accepting it, because the rule existed for
a reason and the rule was bypassed.

**Decision: accept it, do not revert.** The work was verified 76/76, both
migrations are reversible, `custody-scan` and `migration-check` are clean, and it
is live with real rows. Reverting a live, tested schema change to satisfy a
process rule after the fact would create risk rather than remove it.

**Actions:**
- Close `feat/multi-asset-instruments` and `feat/spine-trading-hours` as
  superseded — keeping stale duplicates of merged work invites someone
  re-merging them.
- **One thing did NOT land with it and is a real gap:** `assertMarketOpen` /
  trading-hours enforcement on the order-create path. The instrument model knows
  each market's schedule; nothing checks it. **A weekend EUR/USD order is
  accepted today.** That is now a spine work item, not a merge decision.

## Not decided here

- **Sanctions blocklist contents** — the mechanism exists and refuses to boot
  without a list in staging or prod. What goes in it is counsel's, with Nitro.
- **CORS origins** for the Java modules — needs the real origin list.
- **Wallet keystore re-encryption** (A1.4) — existing ETH deposit keystores were
  created with an empty password; once a real one is set they stop decrypting.
  Sequencing that is a live-custody operation and belongs in A2, deliberately not
  bundled into a licence note.
