/**
 * Mark from matching depth (trade.futures residual).
 *
 * Adapts EngineDepth (bids/asks levels) into a QuotedMarkSource via
 * mid-of-book. Empty or one-sided book → null (never invent). Depth carries no
 * last print, so every quote this source produces is `mid` quality.
 *
 * Does not call matching itself; inject depth reader (svc-matching port).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE MID USED TO BE SIZE-BLIND
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `bestFromDepth` read `depth.bids[0]?.[0]` and `depth.asks[0]?.[0]` — the PRICE
 * at each best level — and threw away the QUANTITY at index 1 entirely. So one
 * wei resting at 1000 and one wei resting at 3000 minted a payout-grade `mid` of
 * 2000, and a close priced off it paid real money out of the profit pot. It was
 * measured before it was fixed: 2,000 USDT on a ten-unit long, against a book
 * holding two orders worth about four femto-cents between them
 * (`position-service.test.ts`, "two dust orders mint a payout-grade mark").
 *
 * WHAT USED TO STAND HERE, AND WHY THIS PARAGRAPH CHANGED. Until
 * `feat/futures-orderable-path` this file said the defect "is not exploitable on
 * `main` today only because `assertTradable` refuses non-spot on the order path,
 * so futures books are always empty" — "a different file's accident, not a
 * control" — and named the change that would make it exploitable.
 *
 * That change has landed. `assertTradable` takes a futures order whenever
 * `TRADE_FUTURES_ENABLED` is on, so a futures book now holds whatever anyone rests
 * in it, two dust orders included. The old sentence is rewritten rather than
 * deleted because it is the argument for the check below: this file, and no longer
 * that one, is what stands between a dust book and a payout. Done-bar item 8 of
 * `docs/adr/2026-08-07-futures-exit-when-the-feed-is-dark.md` is why it could not
 * simply be left standing — "a comment that claims a property the code lacks is
 * worse than no comment, and this one cost us the finding."
 *
 * The order path does not quietly become a second line of defence either. A
 * market's `min_notional` refuses an order too small to matter, but it is a
 * per-listing value chosen when the market is created, so it bounds one order and
 * says nothing about the mark. `futures/orderable-path.test.ts` therefore rests its
 * dust through the real order path of a market whose floor permits it, so that the
 * refusal being tested is this one and not a listing parameter standing in for it.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SO: A BOOK TOO THIN TO BE WORTH ANYTHING IS NOT A QUOTE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A side whose best level carries less than `minBestLevelNotional` is treated as
 * ABSENT, not as cheap. One side absent makes the book one-sided, and a
 * one-sided book already has exactly one honest answer here: null. The refusal
 * therefore arrives through machinery that already existed — no new error code,
 * no second refusal vocabulary.
 *
 * REFUSING RATHER THAN DEGRADING, deliberately. The two alternatives were:
 *
 *   · label it `last`, which the liquidation gate refuses anyway but the
 *     VALUATION gate accepts — so a dust mid would still reach margin-call
 *     arithmetic and a trader's screen as though someone had quoted it;
 *   · walk past the dust to the first level with real size, which invents a
 *     price nobody is actually resting at the top of the book, and quietly
 *     changes what "best bid" means in a file whose whole job is not inventing.
 *
 * Both hide a book that cannot support a trade. "An illiquid book is exactly
 * where a forced sale does most damage" (`prices.ts`) — and it is also exactly
 * where a payout does. The position sits and an operator looks at it, which is
 * the answer this codebase has already chosen twice for the same shape of
 * problem.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * AN ABSOLUTE FLOOR CANNOT GATE AN UNBOUNDED PAYOUT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every paragraph above is still true and all of them together were still
 * insufficient, and the gap was measured: **190,000 USDT out of the profit pot
 * for ten USDT of margin plus about 240 USDT of resting quotes that were
 * refunded in full.** Two orders worth roughly 120 quote units each cleared
 * `DEFAULT_MIN_BEST_LEVEL_NOTIONAL` by twenty percent, and the mid they minted
 * was then used to price the close of a position of ONE MILLION of notional.
 *
 * The defect is not the number. It is that the number is ABSOLUTE while the
 * thing it authorises is not. `bestLevelIsQuotable` was handed a price and a
 * quantity and asked "is this level worth more than 100 units of the quote
 * asset" — a question with no reference to the position whose payout the answer
 * funds. One threshold therefore had to be simultaneously high enough to gate a
 * million-unit position and low enough not to strand a hundred-unit one, and no
 * single number is both. Raising the 100 does not fix it; it moves the size at
 * which the same arithmetic works, and makes ordinary markets unquotable on the
 * way past.
 *
 * ── THE RELATIONSHIP, AND THE ARGUMENT FOR IT ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * **A best level may back a mark that authorises a payout on a position of size
 * S only if that level carries at least `minBestLevelBpsOfNotional` of S.**
 *
 * Stated in BASE units, deliberately rather than for convenience. At the level's
 * own price the two readings are the same statement — `qty >= f*S` is exactly
 * `price*qty >= f*(S*price)`, i.e. the level is worth at least the fraction `f`
 * of the position notional THIS MARK IS MINTING — so nothing is given up, and
 * two bad denominators are avoided. Sizing the requirement off a notional
 * computed at the mark you are deciding whether to trust is not a check, it is a
 * fixed point. Sizing it off the stored entry price instead would rate today's
 * liquidity against a number set when the position opened, which on exactly the
 * market move the breaker exists to catch is the stalest denominator available.
 *
 * WHY A FRACTION IS THE RIGHT SHAPE OF CLAIM. A mark asserts "this position
 * could be closed here". Requiring the whole position to rest at one level would
 * assert something no real venue satisfies — top of book is a fraction of any
 * serious position — and would refuse every honest market and strand every
 * trader in it. A fixed fraction asserts the weaker true thing: whoever is
 * putting this price up must be willing to transact a defined slice of the
 * position AT IT, right now.
 *
 * AND THAT IS WHAT COSTS THE ATTACKER SOMETHING. A resting order is not a
 * signature on a form, it is a live offer that anyone may hit. Dust is free to
 * post precisely because nobody bothers to take four femto-cents, and 120 units
 * against a million of notional is very nearly as free. A level sized as a
 * fraction of the position, resting at a price pushed nineteen percent off the
 * market, is an arbitrage anyone watching can take — and it is required on BOTH
 * sides, so it cannot be hedged against itself. This does not make manipulation
 * impossible. It makes it PROPORTIONAL, which an absolute floor by construction
 * cannot.
 *
 * IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT ALONE, AND IS NOT CLAIMED TO BE. Quotes are refundable —
 * cancel and the maker is whole — so no depth rule makes the attack cost
 * anything that is not actually taken. What bounds the size of the prize is the
 * leverage cap in `initial-margin.ts`: margin genuinely at risk, in a fixed
 * ratio to the notional any mark is allowed to pay out on. Each half leaves the
 * other's hole open, and each is caught by its own test — see
 * `orderable-path.test.ts`.
 *
 * WHERE THE SIZE COMES FROM, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF THE ADR.
 * `docs/adr/2026-08-05-futures-risk-and-mark-law.md`: *a price that moves money
 * is never supplied by the party it pays.* On the CLOSE path the size is read
 * from `trade.positions` under the same `FOR UPDATE` as the close it is judging,
 * never from the request. On the OPEN path no stored row exists yet and the size
 * is the caller's — safe in the only direction that matters, because the
 * requirement is monotonically INCREASING in it and the number is written
 * verbatim into the row by the same statement. Understating it to weaken this
 * gate also opens the smaller position that was claimed; overstating it tightens
 * the gate against the caller. Neither is a price, and neither names a payout.
 *
 * NOT WIRED INTO THE LIQUIDATION TICK, deliberately, and said out loud rather
 * than left to be discovered. A liquidation pays the HOUSE, not the trader, and
 * refusing one leaves the platform holding risk it has already judged to be past
 * its margin. Widening the conditions under which a liquidation refuses is a
 * liquidation parameter, squarely `DIRECTION` §8 item 8 — so it waits for the
 * same ruling the numbers below are waiting for, instead of arriving as a side
 * effect of a payout fix. `sideDepthNotional` is on the same boundary and for
 * the same reason: it MEASURES depth for the ladder, it does not authorise a
 * payout, so it runs the absolute floor only.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE NUMBERS ARE RISK PARAMETERS AND THEY ARE THE OWNER'S
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `docs/adr/2026-08-05-futures-risk-and-mark-law.md` reserves "any leverage or
 * margin parameter beyond §1's stated defaults" to the owner (`DIRECTION` §8
 * item 8). A minimum book depth is one of those, and so is the fraction of a
 * position that must rest behind its mark. What is implemented here is the
 * MECHANISM and its refusal; both numbers are conservative placeholders, each
 * lives in exactly one named constant, and both are per-deployment configuration
 * on one policy object rather than something scattered through the call sites.

 * MINIMUM RESTING NOTIONAL AT A BEST LEVEL, IN QUOTE-ASSET UNITS.

 * `100` means: for a `BTC/USDT-PERP` book, the best bid and the best ask must
 * each be worth at least 100 USDT (price × quantity) before their mid may be
 * minted as a payout-grade mark. Two 1-wei orders come to roughly 1e-15 quote
 * units and are refused by fifteen orders of magnitude.
 *
 * Conservative and deliberately unambitious: it is chosen to be far above dust
 * and far below anything a real market maker rests, so it catches the attack
 * without opining on what a liquid book looks like. It is a placeholder for an
 * owner ruling, not a considered risk limit.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION, stated rather than papered over: the threshold is one number
 * in QUOTE units and is applied to every futures market. That is right while
 * every futures market is quoted in USDT and wrong the day one is quoted in BTC,
 * where 100 of the quote asset is an enormous order. Per-market thresholds are a
 * risk-parameter table and squarely the owner's call, so this file does not
 * invent one — it takes a policy object so the owner's answer has somewhere to
 * land without touching any call site.
 *
 * IT GOVERNS THE VENUE PATH TOO. `mark-from-venue.ts` mids an EXTERNAL venue's
 * public book and had the identical size-blind defect; it now imports this
 * constant, this type and `bestLevelIsQuotable` rather than growing a second
 * floor with a second name. The unit is the same — quote-asset units of the
 * pair being read — and so is the reasoning, so a second default here would be
 * a second unruled number, not a second decision. When the owner rules, they
 * rule once; if they rule DIFFERENTLY for external venues, the mechanism is
 * already there (`createConfiguredVenueMarkSource`'s `depthPolicy`) and no call
 * site has to move.

 * HOW MUCH OF THE POSITION MUST REST BEHIND THE MARK THAT PRICES IT, IN BPS.

 * at least 5 contracts before its price may be half of a mid that authorises a
 * payout on that position; for a long of 10 contracts, 0.1. The requirement
 * scales with what it is being asked to authorise, which is the entire point —
 * see the header section "AN ABSOLUTE FLOOR CANNOT GATE AN UNBOUNDED PAYOUT".
 *
 * ONE PERCENT IS DELIBERATELY A WEAK CLAIM, and it is chosen to be weak. It says
 * a real market's top level can absorb a hundredth of the position being priced
 * off it — far less than any liquid book actually shows, and far more than an
 * attacker can post for free at a price nineteen percent off the market on both
 * sides at once. Against the measured exploit it is not close: 0.06 BTC rested
 * against a 500-contract position is 0.012% of it, under the requirement by two
 * orders of magnitude. Against the honest book in the same test file — 10
 * contracts resting behind a 10-contract position, 10,000 bps — it is not close
 * in the other direction either. The gap between those two is where the number

 * is a decision and reads like one.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION, stated rather than papered over: like the absolute floor, it
 * is one number applied to every futures market. A market whose honest top of
 * book is genuinely thinner than 1% of the positions traded on it would freeze
 * closes rather than pay them — the ADR's chosen failure direction (the position
 * sits and an operator looks at it), but a real cost, and the reason
