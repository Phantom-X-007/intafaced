 * discount is floored, so the effective rate rounds UP — value credited to a
 * user is floored so rounding never invents value that has to come from
 * somewhere (`money.ts`).
 *
 * The honest consequence, stated rather than hidden: on a market with a small
 * published fee, a small discount rounds away entirely. A 25 bps discount on a
 * 10 bps maker fee is 0.025 bps, which is not representable, so the user pays
 * 10. That is a limitation of integer basis points, and integer basis points
 * are what the `tradeFill` recipe accepts.
 *
 * SOCKET §13 — amount-level fee discounting. Applying the discount to the fee
 * AMOUNT rather than to the RATE keeps all 18 decimal places, and is exactly
 * the change `feeCharge`'s token branch already makes for IFC-settled fees. It
 * needs `tradeFill` to accept fee amounts instead of bps, which is a
 * `packages/ledger-client` change and therefore its own PR first (§15.2).
