/**
 * RAW REQUEST BYTES, RETAINED (the mechanism L2-6 was deferred for).
 *
 * The original S2S signature covered `service` and a timestamp and not the body,
 * and the reason given was accurate: "Fastify has already parsed and discarded
 * [the raw bytes] by the time the tRPC plugin builds a context." You cannot
 * digest bytes you no longer have.
 *
 * ── What was measured, not assumed ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Fastify 5.10.0, probed directly before this was written:
 *
 *   · `addContentTypeParser('application/json', { parseAs: 'buffer' }, …)`
 *     **overrides the built-in JSON parser without a prior
 *     `removeContentTypeParser`.** Worth checking, because Fastify throws
 *     `FST_ERR_CTP_ALREADY_PRESENT` for a duplicate parser in other cases and
 *     the safe-looking `remove`-then-`add` would itself throw once anything else
 *     had already replaced the parser.
 *   · `parseAs: 'buffer'` hands over the wire bytes **verbatim** — key order,
 *     runs of whitespace, and multi-byte characters all survive (a body with
 *     `café` arrived as 49 bytes for 48 characters, and re-encoded identically).
 *     This is what makes digesting sound; `JSON.stringify(req.body)` would not
 *     be, since neither key order nor whitespace is canonical.
 *   · A `; charset=utf-8` parameter on the content type still routes to the
 *     `application/json` parser, so a caller adding one does not slip past.
 *   · A bodyless request — `GET`, or `POST` with no content-type — **never
 *     invokes a content-type parser at all**, while an `onRequest` hook always
 *     runs. That asymmetry is the entire reason for the `onRequest` marker
 *     below: without it, "this request had no body" and "this service never kept
 *     the bytes" are the same observation, and they must not be.
 *
 * ── Behaviour this deliberately preserves ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Replacing the JSON parser means owning its error cases. Fastify's default
 * answers 400 with `FST_ERR_CTP_EMPTY_JSON_BODY` for an empty body and 400 with
 * `FST_ERR_CTP_INVALID_JSON_BODY` for malformed JSON, so the parser below
 * reproduces both — status **and** `code`, because a caller or a log filter may
 * be matching on either. A silent change from 400 to 500 on the money path
 * because a parser was swapped would be a poor trade for a security fix.
 *
 * ── Why a WeakMap and not `req.rawBody` ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The common recipe assigns the bytes onto the request object. That works, and
 * costs a global `FastifyRequest` type augmentation that leaks into every package
 * importing Fastify's types, plus a property whose name is a plain string on an
 * object a request handler can otherwise write to. Keying a module-private
 * WeakMap on the request object gives the same lifetime (entries die with the
 * request) with no ambient type change and nothing reachable from outside this
 * module.
