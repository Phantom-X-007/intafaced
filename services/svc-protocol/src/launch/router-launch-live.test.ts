 * THE WHOLE LAUNCH, THROUGH THE ROUTER, AGAINST A REAL CHAIN
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `token-factory-onchain.test.ts` proves the contracts behave. This proves the
 * SERVICE does, which is a different claim — everything a creator ever touches
 * is the router, not the contracts.
 *
 * The load-bearing detail is that this test never builds its own calldata. It
 * takes the exact bytes `buildTokenDeployment` returned, broadcasts those, and
 * checks the token landed where `predictTokenAddress` said it would. A test
 * that hand-assembled the call would prove the contracts agree with the test,
 * which is not the question. The question is whether the two procedures a
 * creator actually uses agree with EACH OTHER and with the chain.
 *
 * That is the failure this rules out: a service that predicts one address and
 * hands out calldata deploying to another. Both halves look correct in
 * isolation, and every launch goes to an address nobody was shown.
 *
 * Needs a chain (`docker compose up -d evm`); skips loudly without one, and is
 * a hard failure on CI where `REQUIRE_EVM_CHAIN=1`.
