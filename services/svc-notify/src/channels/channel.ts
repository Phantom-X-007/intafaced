/**
 * THE CHANNEL INTERFACE — Doctrine §0.4, "adapters, not integrations".
 *
 * Every way of reaching a user is one of these. The in-app inbox is a channel
 * like any other; email, push and SMS are channels that need credentials the
 * owner may not have yet. That symmetry is the point: the dispatcher has one
 * code path, and "we cannot reach you by email" is a first-class recorded
 * outcome rather than a branch someone forgot.
 *
 * THE THREE OUTCOMES, AND WHY THEY ARE THREE
 *
 *   accepted   The adapter handed the message to its transport and the transport
 *              ACCEPTED IT FOR DELIVERY. That is the whole claim. It is not
 *              "received", it is not "read", and no channel in this service ever
 *              learns either of those — see WHAT "ACCEPTED" DOES NOT MEAN below.
 *   refused    The adapter declined BEFORE attempting anything: no credentials,
 *              no address on file, address never confirmed, address not routable
 *              on this channel. Terminal, and the reason is recorded. A refusal
 *              is never a silent drop — the code is on the delivery row and
 *              readable through the API.
 *   failed     It was attempted and it did not work. Retryable or not.
 *
 * A design where "refused" and "accepted" are both `void` is how an undelivered
 * margin call comes to look like a delivered one. svc-bank already keeps
 * `notifiedAt` separate from `calledAt` for exactly this reason; this is the
 * same discipline one layer out.
 *
 * WHAT "ACCEPTED" DOES NOT MEAN — READ THIS BEFORE BUILDING A CLOCK ON IT
 *
 * A gateway answering 2xx has taken custody of the message. It has not said the
 * mail server accepted it, that the handset was reachable, or that a human saw
 * it. We do not receive delivery receipts and we do not model them, so the
 * strongest true statement this service can make is "a transport accepted it",
 * and that is exactly what the status and the column are named.
 *
 * The reason this is spelled out rather than assumed: svc-bank stamps a margin
 * call `notified_at` and starts the liquidation grace clock from it. A clock
 * that gates somebody's collateral must never be started by a word that means
 * less than the reader thinks it means. `accepted` is the weakest true word
 * available, deliberately.
 *
 * PROVIDER NAMES LIVE IN CONFIGURATION, NOT HERE (§0.7). No adapter in this
 * directory names a vendor, and none ever should — the transport is a URL and a
 * credential the owner sets, and whoever is behind that URL is the owner's
 * business, not this codebase's.
