 * No database and no engine: everything here is a pure function, and testing it

 * runs in a millisecond, it can be explained to a user.
 *
 * The property under test throughout is the one §7.1 asks for and the one a
 * person would notice breaking: **same input, same placement** — and a
 * preference for crews that complement rather than duplicate.
