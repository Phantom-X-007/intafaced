/**
 * DOES THIS PRINCIPAL OWN THIS MERCHANT? — asked in exactly one place.
 *
 * The rule is three lines and it is the only thing standing between a merchant
 * id in a query string and somebody else's payment history. It used to live
 * inside `router.ts` as a private helper that threw a `TRPCError`, which was
 * correct while tRPC was the only way in.
 *
 * `pay.public-api` adds a second way in (docs/adr/2026-08-07-pay-public-api-law.md),
 * and the ADR's rule for it is that REST is a TRANSLATION: "any behaviour that
 * differs between REST and tRPC is a defect in the REST layer". A rule copied
 * into two files is a rule with two futures — so it moved here, and both
 * surfaces call it. The transports differ only in how they render the refusal:
 * tRPC maps it to FORBIDDEN, REST to 403.
 *
 * Throws `PayError` rather than a transport error for the same reason: a domain
 * refusal that already knows about HTTP cannot be reused by anything that is
 * not HTTP.
