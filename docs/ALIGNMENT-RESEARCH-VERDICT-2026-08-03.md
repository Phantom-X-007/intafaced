# Is our alignment approach “how seniors / agentic eng do it” — or over-engineering?

**Type:** Research + judgment (not a new mega-process)  
**Date:** 2026-08-03  
**Question:** Should we run the full ALIGNMENT program, or a thinner “right way”?

---

## Verdict (one line)

**The *goals* are normal and correct for agentic teams. A 7-wave program with dozens of gates is heavier than seniors usually keep permanently — keep a thin operating system, cut the ceremony.**

---

## What research says is normal (2025–2026)

### Senior / classic engineering
- **Single source of truth** for decisions; link, don’t copy the same table into five docs (stale duplicate = classic failure).  
- **Code + tests** carry day-to-day truth; docs capture *law and orientation*, not every chat.  
- Monorepos win on **one place for conventions** — same idea as “agents need one entry,” not 189 competing briefs.

### Agentic engineering (how strong AI-assisted teams work now)
| Practice | Status in field | Our situation |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| **Short always-on instructions** (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / rules) | Standard “context engineering” | You already have this — **keep, keep thin** |
| **Git worktrees for parallel agents** | Mainstream pattern (Nx, Cursor multi-agent guides, many 2025–26 writeups) | **Keep** — you already use them; 142 rotting trees is the bug, not worktrees |
| **Fetch tip / don’t trust stale local** | Basic professionalism | **Keep** — your laptop is 160 behind |
| **Specs / ADRs for money & product law** | Rising “spec-driven” + old ADR practice | **Keep** ADRs you already accepted |
| **Land orientation on main so cold agents see it** | “Repos in repo,” knowledge priming | **Keep** — maps only on laptop = agents drift |
| **Giant parallel doc piles / multi-wave meta-programs** | Anti-pattern when they **duplicate** and go **stale** | **Cut** — research/FRONTEND* dumps are the risk |
| **Monolithic 2000+ word root prompts** | Called out as signal dilution | **Don’t grow** session paste into a novel |

Sources (field practice, not blog folklore alone): monorepo.tools on single SoT; SIGPLAN “repositories as human/agent knowledge factories” on **stale duplicate** as top agent failure; Packmind context-engineering playbook on scoped rules vs monolith prompts; widespread 2025–26 worktree+multi-agent guides; Fowler/Willison line: **agentic engineering ≠ vibe coding** (tests, real docs, responsibility).

## What “right way” means for *you* (3 people + heavy agents)

Not FAANG process. Not zero process.

**Minimum viable alignment (MVA) — this is the senior move:**

1. **One product default on main** (shell :8090; not apps/web) in START-HERE + session prompt + AGENTS.  
2. **Always worktree from fetched `origin/main`.** Never code on dirty main.  
3. **≤1 short law pack on main** (Bizzan one-pager + “what not to rebuild” + owners) — **link**, don’t fork.  
4. **`gh pr list` + don’t touch open Denon/Shehzad paths** — re-derive every session (no frozen PR table as law).  
5. **Ship FE on shell** after that. Cleanup of worktrees/docs is **background**, not a multi-week gate before product.  
6. **CI gates** that encode law (you already have brand/custody/workspace-sync) > more markdown.

**That’s how agentic seniors move:** small durable constraints in-repo + isolation + tip discipline + ship. Not a permanent “Wave W0–W7 program office.”

## What would be vibe-coded over-engineering (limit you)

| Pattern | Why it limits you |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| Treating **189 untracked research docs** as the system | Agents pick wrong file; you never finish “cleanup” |
| **Re-running full recovery archaeology** every week | Already done; diminishing returns |
| **Seven mandatory waves before any FE PR** | Process becomes the product |
| **Multiple “truth” docs** with the same ownership table | Stale duplicate — field’s #1 agent failure |
| **Keeping 142 worktrees** “in case” | Disk + false lost-work anxiety (field reports 100s of worktrees as cost of agents — **GC is normal hygiene**, not a project) |
| **Building a second process framework** on top of AGENTS + ADR + tracker | You already have law; add *entry refresh*, not a new religion |

## Judgment on our written ALIGNMENT program

| Part of program | Keep? | Note |
| --------------- | ----- | ---- |
| Product law (shell, ledger, owners) | **Yes** | Core |
| Land 5–6 maps on main + refresh START-HERE/session | **Yes** | One PR; high leverage |
| Stop dirty-main coding | **Yes** | Non-negotiable |
| Discard local shell regressions | **Yes** | 5 minutes |
| #425 / purge review | **Yes** | Real work items |
| Residual → short FE board | **Yes** | Thin list, not a campaign OS |
| Full W0–W7 as permanent ritual | **No** | Use as **optional checklist once**, then delete ceremony |
| Bulk GC 294 branches as blocking | **No** | Do in idle agent pass; don’t block FE |
| Archive research docs | **Yes, lazily** | Zip/delete offline; don’t PR bulk |

---

## Recommended path (research-backed, proportional)

**Do this week (thin):**
1. One **docs PR**: START-HERE + session prompt refresh + link Bizzan peace map + recovery one-screen + owners.  
2. Agents: **worktree only** from tip.  
3. Merge **#425** when green.  
4. First **shell FE** tasks from residual/i18n scan — product motion.

**Do when free (hygiene, not drama):**  
5. Delete merged worktrees / squash-ghost branches.  
6. Archive local research docs outside git or trash.

**Do not:**  
- Invent another 40-page process.  
- Wait for “perfect clean laptop” before shipping.  
- Re-litigate Bizzan vs apps/web every chat.

## Bottom line for Nitro

| Question | Answer |
| -------- | ------ |
| Is alignment “how seniors do it”? | **Yes** for *thin* SoT + tip + isolation + clear product. |
| Is a huge multi-wave cleanup program how they live day to day? | **No** — that’s crisis recovery, not steady state. |
| Is worktree + AGENTS.md agentic best practice? | **Yes** — widely adopted 2025–26. |
| Will thick process limit you? | **Yes** if docs multiply and ship waits on janitor waves. |
| Right move? | **Thin OS on main + ship shell. Hygiene in background.** |

*This verdict constrains the ALIGNMENT program: execute MVA, not the full ceremonial wave list as permanent law.*
