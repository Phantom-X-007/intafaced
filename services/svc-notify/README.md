# svc-notify

Event-driven notification fan-out for `ops.notifications`. Bus events become
inbox rows, and inbox rows are then attempted on every channel for which the user
has confirmed an address.

This service holds no balances and posts no ledger transactions.

## The one thing to understand

**An attempt and an outcome are two different facts, and this service never
collapses them.** Every (notification, channel) pair gets a row in
`notify.deliveries` carrying both:

| Column         | Means                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `attempted_at` | we handed it to a transport              |
| `accepted_at`  | a transport accepted it **for delivery** |
| `refusal_code` | why we did not even try                  |

So these three situations stay distinguishable, forever, from the record:

- **a transport took it** — `attempted_at` and `accepted_at` both set
- **we tried and it did not work** — `attempted_at` set, `accepted_at` null
- **we never had anywhere to send it** — both null, `refusal_code` says which

A database CHECK enforces `accepted_at IS NOT NULL` exactly when
`status = 'accepted'`, so no future bug can quietly make an undelivered margin
call read as a delivered one. svc-bank keeps `notified_at` apart from `called_at`
for the same reason; this is that discipline one layer out.

### `accepted`, not `delivered` — and why the column was renamed

The column used to be called `delivered_at`, and it was set the moment a gateway
answered 2xx. **A gateway answering 2xx has taken custody of the message.** It
has not said the mail server took it, that the handset was reachable, or that a
human read it — and this service receives no delivery receipts, so it never
learns any of those things.

`accepted` is the strongest statement the code can support, so it is the word
the status and the column use (migration `0002_notify_delivery_accepted`).

This is not pedantry. svc-bank stamps a margin call `notified_at` and runs the
liquidation grace clock off that stamp. A word that decides whether somebody's
collateral is sold must mean exactly what it says, and nothing downstream should
read `accepted` as "the borrower knows".

## Channels

Four channels, one interface (`NotificationChannel`, Doctrine §0.4).

| Channel | Transport                              | Needs                                                     |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inapp` | the inbox row itself                   | nothing — always available                                |
| `email` | authenticated POST to a configured URL | `NOTIFY_EMAIL_GATEWAY_URL` + `NOTIFY_EMAIL_GATEWAY_TOKEN` |
| `push`  | authenticated POST to a configured URL | `NOTIFY_PUSH_GATEWAY_URL` + `NOTIFY_PUSH_GATEWAY_TOKEN`   |
| `sms`   | authenticated POST to a configured URL | `NOTIFY_SMS_GATEWAY_URL` + `NOTIFY_SMS_GATEWAY_TOKEN`     |

### Mountain vs §13 sockets (D26-P1-O5)

| Tracker id            | Plane                 | What it means                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ops.notifications`   | **Fan-out mountain**  | Bus → inbox → delivery rows. In-app **delivers**. Status stays `ready`, not `done`, while every out-of-app channel refuses in real deploys. |
| `socket.notify-email` | §13 credential socket | Adapter shipped; refuse `channel.not_configured` until Class X credentials.                                                                 |
| `socket.notify-push`  | §13 credential socket | Same.                                                                                                                                       |
| `socket.notify-sms`   | §13 credential socket | Same.                                                                                                                                       |

`notify.channels` and `GET /ready` carry `socket` on each channel status: `null`
for `inapp` (mountain surface), `socket.notify-*` for the three out-of-app
channels. Machine matrix: `src/channels/mountain-vs-sockets.ts`. Closing a
socket is owner work — [`docs/OWNER-ACTIONS-NOTIFY-GATEWAYS.md`](../../docs/OWNER-ACTIONS-NOTIFY-GATEWAYS.md)
— never inventing a provider name in code (§0.7).

**A channel with no credentials is registered, not omitted.** It refuses every
message with `channel.not_configured`, the refusal lands on the delivery row, and
`GET /ready` and `notify.channels` both name the environment variables that are
missing. Nothing is dropped in silence and nothing reports a send that did not
happen.

**URL+token is configured, not reachable.** `/ready.channels` and `notify.channels`
report `configured: true` and `reason: channel.unprobed` until a POST proves a
2xx. This process does not probe at boot. `available: true` is `inapp` only.

**A channel the deployment DEPENDS ON is a different case, and it is fatal.**
`NOTIFY_REQUIRED_CHANNELS` lists the out-of-app channels this deployment cannot
do without; anything on it whose pair of variables is missing stops the boot,
naming the variable. In `APP_ENV=staging|prod` the variable itself has no default
and its absence stops the boot too — write `none` to record "in-app only, on
purpose". Same posture as `EDGE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET`, for the same reason: an
honest refusal on every message is still a silent outage if nobody reads the
delivery table. Dev and test require nothing, so no gateway is needed to run the
stack or the suite.

**No provider is named anywhere in this service** (§0.7). The transport is a URL
and a bearer token the owner sets; whoever answers that URL — a mail relay, a
push service, an SMS aggregator, the owner's own forwarder — is configuration.
That also makes changing provider an env change rather than a release.

What the owner has to obtain, in plain language:
[`docs/OWNER-ACTIONS-NOTIFY-GATEWAYS.md`](../../docs/OWNER-ACTIONS-NOTIFY-GATEWAYS.md).

### The gateway contract

Every channel sends the same request shape and differs only in the body:

```
POST <gateway url>
authorization: Bearer <token>
idempotency-key: <notificationId>:<channel>
content-type: application/json
```

| Channel | Body                                                                                           |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `email` | `channel, notificationId, to, locale, severity, kind, subject, text, href, titleKey, bodyKey`  |
| `push`  | `channel, notificationId, to, locale, severity, kind, title, body, titleKey, bodyKey, data{…}` |
| `sms`   | `channel, notificationId, to, locale, severity, kind, text, titleKey, bodyKey`                 |

`push.data` carries `{ href, kind, notificationId }` — the routing facts the app
needs to open the right screen, kept out of the two fields a push service shows a
user.

Copy arrives **already rendered**, server-side, from `@intafaced/i18n` — so an
out-of-app message can never carry copy a screen could not (§9) or copy the brand
scan has not seen (§0.7). The keys ride along for a gateway with its own
templates.

**Addresses are validated per channel before anything is sent.** A mailbox with
no domain, a phone number that is not E.164, a device token containing
whitespace: all refused with `channel.target_unroutable`, and no request is made.
A gateway handed a local-format number still sends it somewhere, and which
country that somewhere is in is the carrier's guess, not ours.

**SMS is composed and capped.** One `text` field, `title: body href`, cut to
`NOTIFY_SMS_MAX_CHARS` (480 — three GSM segments) from the body outwards so the
fact and the link survive. SMS is billed per segment; an unbounded body is an
unbounded bill.

**Responses.** Any 2xx is acceptance; `{"id": "..."}` is stored as the reference,
and a 2xx with no body is accepted with a null reference. 408 / 425 / 429 / 5xx
are retried. Other 4xx are not — including **401 / 403, deliberately**: a rejected
credential rejects every message, so retrying turns one bad token into three
times the traffic against somebody's auth endpoint and a plausible IP block.
A redirect is **not followed** (`redirect: 'error'`), so the bearer token never
reaches a host the owner did not configure.

**Retries are bounded by `NOTIFY_MAX_DELIVERY_ATTEMPTS` and by nothing else.**
The adapters contain no retry loop of their own — the bound lives in the
`notify.deliveries` claim, which is in the database and therefore survives the
process dying mid-attempt. `src/channels/gateway-wire.test.ts` counts the
requests **at the server** to prove it, because an attempt counter we keep
ourselves is exactly the number that would still look right if an adapter
retried underneath it.

## Addresses

svc-notify owns `notify.channel_targets`. It does **not** read
`identity.users.email` — §2 forbids reaching into another service's tables, and a
login address is not consent to be texted.

Registering an address sends a six-digit code **through the channel being
registered**, which proves the address belongs to the user and proves the channel
works in one step. Nothing is ever sent to an address whose `verified_at` is
null, and changing an address clears its confirmation.

If the channel has no credentials, registration still records the address and
returns `{ status: 'refused', code: 'channel.not_configured' }` — the truth,
rather than a green tick over silence.

**Mounted, and proven mounted.** `router.mount.test.ts` proves authorisation
through `createCaller`, which is the right tool for that job and blind to a
different one: it invokes procedures in-process, so it stays green on a service
whose HTTP mount was never registered, sits at the wrong prefix, or was wired to a
context factory that ignores the edge signature.
`mount.reachable.test.ts` assembles the mount the way `index.ts` does — same
plugin, same prefix, same context factory — **listens on a real socket** and asks
over the wire. This service's own history is a complete consumer nobody wired, so
"is it reachable" is asked by a request, not by reading code.

Every procedure is self-only via `principal.userId`. Title/body are i18n keys
(`title_key` / `body_key`); clients render copy from `@intafaced/i18n`
(`notify.*` keys). `notify.deliveries` is user-facing on purpose: if a margin
call's email never went out, the person whose collateral is at risk is the one
who most needs to see it.

**Mute law.** `notify.setMute` silences out-of-app `info` / `action` traffic on
one channel. Prefs live in `notify.channel_mutes` (migration `0003`) so a restart
cannot silently unmute. **Critical** severity never respects mute — a muted
email channel still receives margin calls, and the delivery row says `accepted`
or a real refusal, never `channel.muted`.

### Edge path

Reach this service through **svc-edge** (not direct to port 4015 in production):

| Client path                        | Upstream                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/notify/trpc/<procedure>` | `GET /trpc/<procedure>` on svc-notify (`NOTIFY_URL`, default `http://localhost:4015`) |

Edge strips `/api/notify` and forwards the rest; auth is the edge-signed
principal header (same as every other mounted service).

### Idempotency and backpressure

Inserts dedupe on `(user_id, source_subject, source_idempotency_key)`. Each send
claims `(notification_id, channel)` atomically, so a redelivered event produces
one row and one message even across replicas. A redelivery still runs fan-out —
that is what recovers a send lost to a crash between the insert and the
transport.

A handler naks **only** when a channel wants another attempt (timeout, 503). A
permanently broken address does not nak: doing so would burn the redelivery
budget for the whole message and eventually park a notification that three other
other channels handled perfectly. After `NOTIFY_MAX_DELIVERY_ATTEMPTS` the row is
`abandoned` rather than left looking like it is still being retried.

**Two things write `abandoned`, and the second one is why the first sentence is
true.** The claim retires a spent row when a later redelivery arrives — but a
message that reaches the attempt ceiling and `max_deliver` together is parked by
JetStream, and no later redelivery arrives. A one-minute sweep
(`reapExhausted`, wired in `index.ts`) retires those rows on the same predicate
the claim uses, **and** retires stuck-`pending` rows whose claim lease has been
dead longer than the bus redelivery window (`STUCK_PENDING_GRACE_MS` =
maxDeliver × ack_wait). That second arm closes the hole where `in_flight` naks
burn `max_deliver` without raising `attempts`, so the attempts-ceiling arm never
fires and the row would otherwise sit `pending` forever. It writes only a failure
— never an attempt, never an acceptance — and never touches a row whose claim
lease is still live. The refusal code names which arm fired:
`channel.attempts_exhausted` when the attempt budget was spent, and
`channel.delivery_stuck` when the bus window elapsed with attempts still left
(so a row with attempts 1 of 3 never pretends the budget was exhausted).

**Register / verify rate limits.** Per `userId`+channel, default 3 registers /
10 verifies per 15 minutes. Named refuse codes, not silent drops. Production
uses a **fixed** window in Postgres (`notify.target_rate_windows`, migration
`0005`) claimed with `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, so two replicas share one budget
rather than each holding an N× in-process counter. Unit tests may inject the
memory limiter, which is a true sliding window — prod is fixed so the shared
row stays simple; a burst exactly on the reset edge can spend up to ~2× max
across two adjacent windows, not N× per pod.

**Consent footer.** Out-of-app bodies from `renderNotification` append
`notify.channel.footer` (catalog). Verification messages do not (address is still
unconfirmed).

### Refusal codes (the wire vocabulary)

Codes, not sentences — clients render copy from `@intafaced/i18n`. Every code a
row can carry is listed in `allRefusalCodes()` (`channels/channel.ts`); a pin
test fails if production writes a string missing from that list.

| Code                            | Means                                                                                                |

| `channel.unprobed`              | URL+token set; this process has not POSTed. `/ready` / `notify.channels` door — never a delivery row |

The table is the tip wire vocabulary — a pin test fails if it drifts from
`allRefusalCodes()`.

`intafaced.bank.margin_call.created` is keyed `<loanId>:<sequence>`, not
`<loanId>` — a loan can be called, cured and called again, and the second call is
a different fact.

### `trade.order.updated` — terminal statuses only

That subject is published on every order row change (pending / open / filled /
cancelled / rejected / expired). Fills already have `fill.settled`. Pending and
open are things the trader just did, and the private WS already fans the live
row. The inbox consumer writes only on **cancelled**, **rejected**, and
**expired** — the cases that can complete while the app is closed.

Which other statuses deserve a message is product law. It lives in
`DEFAULT_ORDER_TERMINAL_NOTIFY_POLICY` (`src/events.ts`). Severity is `info`
(mute may apply). The key is `<orderId>:<status>`; `ts` is not part of it.

### `trade.position.updated` — one transition of four

That subject is published on **every** futures position transition, and again
when a moving mark price liquidates one. Fanning all of them out would put an
inbox row, and for anyone with a confirmed address an email, behind every open
and every close a trader makes. An inbox nobody reads is the same outage as an
inbox nothing writes to, so the consumer notifies on `liquidated` **only**:
opening, closing and closed are things the trader just did, and a liquidation is
the one that happened to them while they were not looking.

Which other transitions deserve a message is product law and has not been
decided. It lives in `DEFAULT_POSITION_NOTIFY_POLICY` (`src/events.ts`) as a
policy object with the conservative default, rather than as an `if` — widening
it is a change to `statuses` plus two i18n keys per new state. It is
deliberately **not** an environment variable: which notifications exist is a
product fact that should read the same in every deployment.

The row is `critical` for the same reason the margin call is: refusals get
recorded on every out-of-app channel even when the trader registered none, and a
channel mute does not silence it. The key is `<positionId>:<status>`, so a
widened policy cannot collapse two transitions of one position into one row —
and `ts` is deliberately not part of it, so a producer re-publishing with a
fresh timestamp cannot turn a duplicate into a second liquidation notice.

A `critical` notification records a refusal on **every** out-of-app channel even
when the user registered none, so "we had no way to reach you" is a row written
at the moment it mattered rather than an inference from an empty table later.

### Consumers whose stream does not exist yet

A durable consumer cannot be created against a stream no service has published
to. When that happens the consumer is reported as **pending** on `GET /ready` and
logged at info (declared wiring socket) or error (undeclared defect), rather than
failing the whole boot or being skipped in silence. Nothing is lost: JetStream
retains 90 days and the consumer replays from the start of the stream on a later
boot.

`intafaced.bank.margin_call.created` used to sit in that state; svc-bank now
owns the bank stream and publishes margin calls. The consumer attaches when the
stream is present — pending is no longer the steady state for that subject.

## Price alerts (v22.alerts MVP)

Watchlists live here: a user sets `marketId` + `above|below` + decimal-string
`targetPrice`. Evaluation rides the same fan-out as every other notification
(`NotifyService.create` → inbox + channels). There is no second delivery path.

| Procedure            | Scope          | Effect                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `notify.alerts`      | `notify:read`  | the caller's watches **+ whether one can fire**   |
| `notify.createAlert` | `notify:write` | create a watch, returned with the same disclosure |
| `notify.cancelAlert` | `notify:write` | cancel an active watch                            |

**Evaluation is a mounted sweep, and it used to be nothing at all.**
`evaluateMarket` shipped complete and tested with **no caller**: this file and
`router.ts` both called it "an internal job path" and there was no job. A user
created a watch, got `status: 'active'`, and nothing ever looked at the row again
— D-S-13 Class B, the same shape as `bankMarginCalled` parking with a finished
consumer. `AlertService.evaluateDueAlerts` now fans in from `activeMarkets()` (so
a watch on a market nobody enumerated is still evaluated) and `index.ts` drives it
every `ALERT_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS`, clearing it on shutdown. The last pass is on
`/ready`; a null `lastAt` means the driver never ran.

**Dark mark refuse.** Evaluation is pure (`evaluatePriceAlert`) against an
injected mark port. `acceptAlertMark` is the accepted-mark gate: a `kind: 'dark'`
source cannot fire even if `quote()` invents `{ kind: 'ok' }`, and an absent
quote is refused rather than treated as zero. A live `{ kind: 'ok' }` whose
`at` is older than 300s (same ticker window bank uses for loan marks) or dated
more than 30s in the future is `stale` / `refused` — a one-shot must not fire
on a memory. When the accepted mark is unavailable (dark / stale / refused),
the outcome is `alert.price_unavailable` and **nothing is written to the inbox**.

**Out-of-app required.** If this deployment listed a channel in
`NOTIFY_REQUIRED_CHANNELS` and that channel cannot deliver, a crossing watch
refuses `channel.not_configured` / `channel.disabled` by name — it does not
silently drop the device leg and mark the watch fired. Inbox-only (nothing
required) remains the honest fallback; sockets stay open (tracker `ready`).

**Live mark when `TRADE_URL` is set.** Production injects
`createTradeHttpMarkSource` against svc-trade's public REST — the same
`GET /api/v1/markets` + `GET /api/v1/ticker/:symbol` surface svc-bank already
uses for loan marks (mid when two-sided, else last; decimal strings only).
Unset / blank `TRADE_URL` keeps the dark port: CRUD still works; fire does not
lie. `kind: 'live'` is claimed only by that factory, never hardcoded in the
entrypoint to look finished.

`MarkSource.kind` (`dark` | `live`) is **required**, because an optional field
with a default is how a dark source silently reads as a live one. It describes
wiring, not weather: a `live` feed may still answer `unavailable` on any given
quote.

**The disclosure rides with the data.** Both read and create return
`evaluation: { markSource, canFire, code }`, so a client cannot render somebody's
watchlist — or confirm a watch they just created — without also receiving the fact
that nothing on it can currently cross. `canFire: true` says the wiring is not
missing and **nothing more**: delivery is best-effort on every channel (§8) and
there is no SLA here.

**One-shot.** Crossing inserts one notification keyed `<alertId>:<markPrice>`,
then marks the row `fired`. Order is deliberate: mark-before-notify used to burn
a watch under fan-out kill or a crash mid-create (status `fired`, empty inbox,
no retry). Notify first; only retire the watch when create produced or recovered
a row. A redelivery reuses the same key and cannot double-send.

Out of scope for this residual (tracker + §31): funding / liquidation-proximity
alerts, whale-flow intelligence tiers, mobile watchlist sync, owner gateway
credentials (Class X — same as every out-of-app channel).

| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NOTIFY_FANOUT_ENABLED`     | Off: consumers ack, nothing is written, nothing is sent anywhere.                                              |
| `NOTIFY_OUT_OF_APP_ENABLED` | Off: inbox still fills; every out-of-app channel refuses `channel.disabled`.                                   |
| `NOTIFY_INCIDENT_SILENCE`   | On: `venueIncident.allFine` stays false until `NOTIFY_INCIDENT_ALL_CLEAR`. Matching resume is not auto-unmute. |
| `NOTIFY_INCIDENT_ALL_CLEAR` | Explicit all-clear. Halt / missing matching source still refuse `allFine`.                                     |
| flag `notify.fanout`        | Module kill-switch in `packages/config`.                                                                       |

The second is the one to reach for during an incident — it silences customers'
phones without also blinding them. It may **not** be combined with a non-empty
`NOTIFY_REQUIRED_CHANNELS`: a deployment that requires a channel and switches all
sending off is a contradiction, and it is the shape a bad rollback takes. The env
schema refuses it.

`NOTIFY_OUT_OF_APP_ENABLED=false` also counts as incident-silence for the venue
claim: health/ready must not read as allFine. Flipping sending back on is not an
all-clear unless `NOTIFY_INCIDENT_ALL_CLEAR` is set and matching `GET /markets`
is actually open.

| `NOTIFY_VERIFY_TTL_MINUTES`             | —       | 1–120. Blank refuses `notify.verify_ttl_unset` — never invent 15. Owner may set 15 explicitly.                                          |
| `TRADE_URL`                             | —       | Unset ⇒ alert marks stay dark. Set ⇒ public ticker mark source (live wiring).                                                           |
| `MATCHING_URL`                          | —       | Unset ⇒ venue halt unwired (not allFine, not invented halt). Set ⇒ consume GET /markets. Never POST /halt-all.                          |
| `NOTIFY_INCIDENT_SILENCE`               | `false` | Latch: matching-open is not allFine until `NOTIFY_INCIDENT_ALL_CLEAR`.                                                                  |
| `NOTIFY_INCIDENT_ALL_CLEAR`             | `false` | Explicit recovered. Halt / unavailable matching still refuse allFine.                                                                   |

An empty string is treated as absent, because that is what `docker compose`
interpolates an unset variable to — otherwise an unwired gateway would fail
`z.string().url()` and take the service down instead of leaving the channel
honestly unconfigured.
