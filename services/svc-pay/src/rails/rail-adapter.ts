/**
 * RailAdapter — the §6.1 adapter interface.
 *
 * Doctrine §0.4: "Adapters, not integrations. All external rails (card issuers,
 * PSP partners, bank rails, liquidity venues) sit behind internal interfaces…
 * the platform never depends on them to function." Every partner rail named in
 * §6.1 plugs in later as an adapter; none of them is named here, because a
 * partner's name has no place in the code that would have to survive them.
 *
 * §6.1 states the claim this file has to make true: every partner rail — card
 * acquiring, PSP, bank — "drops in later as an adapter with zero core changes".
 * That is a testable claim, not a hope, and `conformance.ts` is what tests it —
 * a new adapter passes the kit or it does not merge (§6.3).
 *
 * The shape mirrors `packages/venue-adapter/src/source.ts`, which is how this
 * repo already does adapters: an interface, capability flags, health, and every
 * implementation behind it. The core asks what an adapter can do rather than
 * knowing which adapter it is talking to — that is the entire mechanism by
 * which a new rail costs zero core changes.
 *
 * MONEY IS `Amount` — a scaled bigint — everywhere in this file. A rail that
 * speaks decimal strings or minor units converts at its own boundary, on the
 * way in and on the way out, and never lets a `number` past it.

/**
 * §6.1: `capabilities: RailCapability[]`.

 * THE FIRST FIVE ARE THE ORIGINAL PORT and every registered adapter declares
 * some subset of them. The rest were added when the ADR of 2026-08-04
 * (`docs/adr/2026-08-04-pay-rails-and-psp-socket.md`) established that the port
 * could not express what a card rail does: *"Ours knows authorized | captured |
 * refunded | failed | payout.completed. A card rail needs partial capture, void,
 * 3DS/SCA next-action, disputes, mandates and FX."*
 *
 * ADDING A MEMBER HERE IS NOT ADDING A FEATURE. It is adding a QUESTION the core
 * is allowed to ask an adapter, and the only two honest answers are "yes, and
 * here is the method" and a refusal that names the rail and the operation. There
 * is deliberately no third answer, because the third answer is the one where a
 * rail returns a plausible result for an operation it never performed — see
 * `RailOperationUnsupportedError`.
 *
 * `crypto-native` and `card-sandbox` declare exactly what they declared before
 * this list grew. A capability an adapter does not name is one the core refuses
 * to route to it, so growth here cannot silently change either of them.

/**
 * WHETHER THIS RAIL MOVES REAL MONEY. The most important field on the interface.
 *
 *   live    — a real counterparty is at the other end. A `paid_out` result means
 *             funds actually left, and the `railRef` names a movement somebody
 *             outside this company can be asked about.
 *   sandbox — the counterparty is simulated. Everything on this side of the
 *             interface is real, and NOTHING on the other side is. It SUCCEEDS.
 *   absent  — nothing is behind this rail at all. Every call refuses. The rail is
 *             registered so the core can name it and say why it cannot be used.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE ARE THREE, AND WHY THERE USED TO BE TWO ────────────────────────
 *
 * `ChainPosture` in `chain-port.ts` has had three values from the start, and its
 * comment says why: *"a sandbox succeeds and an absent chain must refuse."*
 * `RailMode` had two, and `crypto-native` collapsed the third into `sandbox`:
 *
 *     this.mode = chain.posture === 'live' ? 'live' : 'sandbox';
 *
 * So a rail that was MISSING and a rail that was DELIBERATELY SIMULATED reported
 * the same thing — and the collapse ran in the unsafe direction, because absence
 * read as a working sandbox. The ADR of 2026-08-04 names this a defect and
 * requires the distinction: *"Make `RailMode` carry `absent` distinctly, or state
 * in the type why it may not."* This is it carrying it.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE COLLAPSE ACTUALLY COST, CONCRETELY ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * It was not only a reporting blur. `defaultChainFor` gives `staging`/`prod` an
 * `UnconfiguredChain` when nothing is configured — that is the DESIGNED
 * production default, and it is the safe one. Under the collapse that chain made
 * `crypto-native` report `sandbox`, `assertRailPosture` counted it as a sandbox
 * rail, and the process REFUSED TO BOOT. The only way out was
 * `PAY_ALLOW_SANDBOX_RAILS=true` — the flag whose whole meaning is "sandbox rails
 * may move value here". The collapse therefore manufactured pressure to set, in
 * production, the exact override it exists to warn about, in order to start a
 * service that had no chain to abuse in the first place.
 *
 * With `absent` distinct, an unconfigured production deployment boots, every
 * crypto call refuses by name with `chain.not_configured`, and the override stays
 * unset and meaningful.
 *
 * ── THE PROPERTY THAT MUST SURVIVE EVERY FUTURE EDIT ─────────────────────────
 *
 * SANDBOX IS NEVER REPORTABLE AS LIVE, BY ANY COLLAPSE, AT ANY LAYER. Widening
 * this type does not touch that: `isLive` is `mode === 'live'` and nothing else,
 * and every posture gate in `posture.ts` lets only `'live'` through and refuses
 * everything else. A member added here is refused by default; it could only ever
 * become permissive by someone editing `isLive`, which is one line, reviewed on
 * its own, and asserted against in `rail-adapter.widening.test.ts`.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ON THE INTERFACE AND NOT IN A CONFIG FILE. An adapter is the only
 * thing that knows whether it has a counterparty; a deployment list of "which
 * rails are real" is a second copy of that fact, and the copy is what goes stale.
 * `card-sandbox` is `sandbox` by construction and cannot be configured otherwise.
 * `crypto-native` is `live` exactly when the chain behind it is live, and it
 * derives its own answer rather than being told.
 *
 * WHAT IT PREVENTS. A withdrawal settled against a sandbox rail debits the user's
 * real ledger balance, returns a fabricated provider reference, and reports
 * `sent`. The user has been told their money moved. There is no worse bug
 * available in this service, and it is not detectable after the fact — the books
 * balance perfectly, because the only thing missing is the money. `posture.ts`
 * is what refuses it; this field is what makes the refusal possible.

 * WHAT A RAIL CALL ENDED UP AS.
 *
 * The first six are the original set. The rest exist because a card rail spends

 * that Hyperswitch's `IntentStatus` has seventeen variants against our six.
 *
 * THE ADDITIONS ARE NOT A COMPLETENESS EXERCISE. Each one is a state in which the
 * core must do something DIFFERENT with a merchant's money, and which was
 * previously indistinguishable from a state where it must not:
 *
 *   partially_captured — value moved, but less than was authorised. Booking this
 *                        as `captured` credits a merchant for the full
 *                        authorization, which is money they were never paid.
 *   voided             — the authorization is released and NOTHING moved. Under
 *                        the old set this could only be reported as `failed`,
 *                        which reads as "the rail broke" to every operator and
 *                        every retry policy, when in fact the platform asked for
 *                        it and it worked.
 *   requires_action    — 3DS/SCA. The payer must do something before this can
 *                        proceed. It is NOT `pending` (which means "waiting for
 *                        the world") and NOT `failed` (which means "give up"):
 *                        collapsing it into either abandons a payer mid-flow,
 *                        holding a challenge they were never shown.
 *   disputed           — the payer's bank has taken the money back pending a
 *                        decision. `payment_status` in the database has had this
 *                        value since `0000_pay_init` with nothing able to reach
 *                        it; this is the rail-side half of reaching it.
 *   reversed           — a movement we already booked has been undone at the
 *                        rail. Distinct from `refunded`: a refund is ours and
 *                        deliberate, a reversal is theirs and imposed.
 *
 * `ok === (status !== 'failed')` still holds for every member. A dispute or a
 * reversal is a true report of something that happened, not a failed call — the
 * call worked, the news is bad, and those are different facts.

// None of it implements a card rail. There is no acquirer — `socket.psp-partners`
// is a sponsor bank and an acquiring BIN, which is a commercial relationship and
// not a code gap, and the ADR of 2026-08-04 settled that no library closes it.
// This is the SHAPE a card rail would plug into, and the refusals that hold the

 * is either released back to the payer or still held against a later capture, and

 * one item shipped today means something entirely different from a merchant

 * Every instinct says a rate is a float. `1.0834`. It fits, it is what the API

 * ON MONEY, so its error is money's error. Multiplying a scaled bigint by a
 * binary float reintroduces every problem `Amount` exists to prevent, one layer
 * up, where nobody is looking for it.
 *
 * So the rate is `rateScaled` — the rate times 10^18, the same scale as `Amount`
 * — and it crosses a wire as a decimal string exactly as an amount does.
 *
 * AND THE QUOTE CARRIES BOTH SIDES ANYWAY. `sourceAmount` and `targetAmount` are
 * both present and both authoritative. The core BOOKS THOSE and never re-derives
 * one from the other through the rate, because the rail's own rounding is the one
 * that determines what actually settles. The rate is for display, audit and
 * disputes; the two amounts are what the ledger sees.

/**
 * THE RAIL CANNOT DO THIS, AND SAYS SO BY NAME.
 *
 * ── WHY A THROW AND NOT A `RailResult` WITH `ok: false` ──────────────────────
 *
 * This is the single most important decision in the widening, and it is settled
 * by `packages/venue-contracts/src/errors.ts`, which met the same fork and wrote
 * down the answer:
 *
 *     "The tempting alternative is to return `{ status: 'rejected' }`, which
 *      type-checks and lets a caller proceed. It is the worst option available:
 *      an execution port that answers plausibly while doing nothing reports fills
 *      that never happened…
 *      A missing key is not a market condition. It is a deployment that is not
 *      finished, and it must read like one."
 *
 * Substitute "a missing capability" for "a missing key" and the argument is
 * unchanged. A failed `RailResult` is the shape of a DECLINE — ordinary traffic,
 * retried, routed around, reported to the merchant as "the issuer said no". A rail
 * that cannot do partial capture has not declined anything. Handing back a
 * decline-shaped object would put "capture the remaining 60 elsewhere" logic in
 * front of an authorization that is still fully held, and would let a merchant be
 * told their partial capture was refused by a bank that was never asked.
 *
 * So: declines are results, and missing capabilities are exceptions. The core
 * cannot proceed past one by accident.
 *
 * WHAT THE MESSAGE HAS TO CONTAIN is what the reader must do next, because the
 * reader is an operator and not a debugger — the same contract
 * `ChainNotConfiguredError` and `SandboxRailError` already keep.

 * why a sandbox behind either of them is a lie rather than a limitation.
 *
 * `authorize` and `capture` are deliberately NOT on this list. They move value
 * INTO the book from a counterparty, and a sandbox authorize is how the whole
 * lifecycle is exercised in CI without a sponsor bank. If a sandbox capture
 * credits a merchant who was never paid, the platform is short — bad, and
 * caught by reconciliation against the rail boundary, which is exactly the
 * figure that exists for it. Nobody has been told their own money left.
 *
 * THE WIDENED CAPABILITIES ARE JUDGED BY THE SAME TEST, and most of them fail it:
 *
 *   capture.partial — value IN, like `capture`. Not on the list.
 *   void            — reaches a hold that never became money. There is nothing to
 *                     send anywhere and nothing on the payer's statement. Not on
 *                     the list, and this is the one worth stating out loud,
 *                     because "void" sounds destructive and is the opposite: it
 *                     is the operation that returns a buyer's headroom to them.
 *   dispute         — the money has already left, taken by the payer's bank. We
 *                     are not the ones moving it, and a sandbox cannot fabricate
 *                     a chargeback into a real account. Not on the list.
 *   mandate         — creates permission to charge, and moves nothing.
 *   fx              — a quote is a number, not a movement. The movement it
 *                     precedes is a payout or a capture, and THAT is gated.
 *
 * So the list does not grow. A capability that fails the "have we told a user
