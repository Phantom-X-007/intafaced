# Dedicated database for migration-applying test suites.
# Never point those suites at the shared `intafaced` DB — schema mutations leak across worktrees.
#
# THIS SCRIPT USED TO SILENTLY DO ALMOST NOTHING, and two separate bugs did it:
#
#  1. The heredoc delimiter was UNQUOTED (`<<EOSQL`), so bash expanded the SQL
#     before psql ever saw it. `DO $$` became `DO <shell pid>` — the dollar-dollar
#     that opens a plpgsql body is also bash's PID variable. The block was a
#     syntax error every single time.
#  2. The loop used `CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS`, which Postgres does not have. So
#     even reaching the block, it aborted on the first service.
#
# Net effect: `intafaced_test` was created and left EMPTY of service schemas. A
# suite pointed at it could not apply its migration, so suites stayed pointed at
# the shared `intafaced` database — which is precisely the cross-worktree leak
# this file exists to prevent, and it is how a branch broke `main`'s tests from
# another checkout.
#
# Both fixed below. The delimiter is quoted ('EOSQL') so the SQL is passed
# through verbatim; nothing in it needs shell expansion.

-- Services whose SQL is schema-qualified — svc-pay, svc-trade, svc-bank write
-- `pay.merchants`, `trade.markets`, `bank.spaces` — cannot be isolated by a
-- generated schema name, because their statements name the schema literally.
-- Those suites therefore take a per-run DATABASE and create the real schema
-- inside it. That needs CREATEDB, which the per-service roles deliberately do
-- not have (§2: a service cannot reach outside its own schema).
--
-- This is a ROLE attribute, not a database grant, so it has to live outside the
-- DO block above. CI already does the equivalent in .github/workflows/ci.yml;
-- without this line a local `docker compose up` produced an ops role that could
-- create schemas but not databases, and every migrated suite failed with
-- "permission denied to create database" — on the developer's machine only.
