# Board Clear — Mega Audit (agentic engineering)

**Date:** 2026-08-01  
**Tip base:** `8b4809f` (+ this PR)  
**Scope:** Methodology completeness, anti-slop, autonomy, drift, research vs industry practice  
**Verdict:** See §8 GREEN LIGHT (hardened)

## 1. Research inputs (industry → Board Clear mapping)

| Source / practice              | Lesson                                                                           | Board Clear control                  |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Anthropic multi-agent research | Orchestrator-worker; parallel clean contexts; plan saved to memory past overflow | SUBAGENT-PROTOCOL; NEXT/DECISION-LOG |
| Anthropic context engineering  | Compaction + structured notes + subagents                                        | Read order; NEXT; workers            |
| Building effective agents      | Orchestrator for unpredictable file sets                                         | Lead re-plans Wave A/B               |
| Production agent anti-patterns | God prompt; vibe-check as testing                                                | Engineering standard; evidence block |
| Vibe coding risks              | Secrets, insecure defaults, no audit trail                                       | Bans; Class M; PR evidence           |
| Verification-before-completion | No claim without fresh command evidence                                          | Iron law §1 in ENGINEERING-STANDARD  |
| Prior Board Clear preflight    | Ownership/LIVE-LANES/UI/#289 conflicts                                           | Fixed; re-checked this audit         |

## 2. Prior pack strengths (keep)

- Locked B decisions + Done bars
- Process loops L0–L7
- Anti-partial-forever (3 ships)
- Unspoken needs explicit
- Preflight fixed C1–C5
- GO paste + scoreboard + NEXT

## 3. Gaps found this mega audit (were limiting quality)

| ID  | Gap                                                                 | Severity | Fix in this PR                       |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| M1  | No explicit **anti-slop catalog** / evidence block                  | High     | ENGINEERING-STANDARD                 |
| M2  | No **subagent spawn contract** (god-agent risk)                     | High     | SUBAGENT-PROTOCOL                    |
| M3  | No **decision log** for plan mutations                              | Medium   | DECISION-LOG                         |
| M4  | No **wave quality audit** heartbeat                                 | Medium   | L8 + WAVE-AUDIT-LATEST               |
| M5  | GRIND-LOOP-ACTIVE still residual-era (product law wait, leave #289) | High     | Supersede pointer                    |
| M6  | Compaction read order omitted ENGINEERING-STANDARD / SUBAGENT       | Medium   | AUTONOMOUS-RUN update                |
| M7  | “Second adversarial” vague                                          | Medium   | Defined as RV1 checklist in standard |
| M8  | No explicit **eval of Done claims** (tracker vs proof)              | Medium   | Finish gate + evidence               |
| M9  | Token waste / thrift not tied to multi-agent research               | Low      | Routing in SUBAGENT-PROTOCOL         |
| M10 | Host session death still requires re-paste                          | Accepted | Documented; not silent OS            |

## 4. AI slop / autonomous failure modes (hunt)

| Failure                      | How Board Clear now combats                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Looks green, unproven        | Evidence block + iron law                       |
| Context rot / compact        | Durable NEXT + full read order                  |
| Drift from goal              | Scoreboard Done/Cut only; constitution          |
| Scope explosion              | One concern PR; PATHS_ONLY workers              |
| Invent to finish             | Hard ban; empty-honest                          |
| Parallel collisions          | LIVE-LANES programs + path exclusivity          |
| Residual theater return      | Supersession of residual/grind product-law wait |
| Fake audits                  | Audit package requirements                      |
| UI wrong tree                | Vendor :8090 enforced                           |
| Orphan PRs                   | #289 A-OR-1; anti-orphan                        |
| Money theater                | Class M + recipes + failure tests               |
| Infinite research            | R1 time-box; then build                         |
| Merge without accountability | Self-audit + evidence                           |

## 5. What we still refuse to “compromise into Done”

- Invent mid/depth/rates/candles
- Class X prod go-live as agent-done
- External firm signature as gate (package yes)
- Force-push Denon spine
- apps/web as product

These are **quality**, not laziness.

## 6. Autonomy completeness

| Requirement             | Status          |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| No Nitro tech questions | YES             |
| No continue loop        | YES (L0 + NEXT) |
| Parallel programs       | YES             |
| Spec/research loops     | YES + anti-slop |
| Subagent isolation      | YES (new)       |
| Compaction resume       | YES (expanded)  |
| Host must run session   | YES (honest)    |
| Board finish definition | YES             |

---

## 7. Recommended GO behavior (orchestrator day one)

1. Claim board-clear-coord on LIVE-LANES
2. Rebase #289 (P-OR)
3. Fan-out 3–5 workers: MM recovery, pay card recipes, UI hotkeys (vendor), SA proof, tracker
4. Every PR: evidence block
5. Every 4 merges: wave audit overwrite
6. Never empty NEXT

## 8. Final green light (mega)

**GREEN LIGHT: YES — hardened.**

Peace-of-mind package is now:

- Constitution + Done bars
- Process loops
- Preflight conflict fixes
- **Engineering standard (anti-slop)**
- **Subagent protocol**
- **Decision log**
- **Wave audit heartbeat**
- Enhanced GO paste

Say GO with `docs/BOARD-CLEAR-AUTONOMOUS-RUN.md` only after this PR is on main.

**Still not claimed:** product already finished; zero defects; infinite uptime without a host agent session.
