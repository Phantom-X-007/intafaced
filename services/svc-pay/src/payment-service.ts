/**
 * svc-pay — THE PAYMENTS CORE (§6.1).
 *
 * Gateway mode only in this PR. PSP mode, PayFac trees, smart routing, fraud
 * scoring, the checkout builder, subscriptions and plugins are each their own
 * tracker feature; none of them changes anything in this file, which is the
 * point of the shape it has.
 *
 * THREE RULES GOVERN EVERY METHOD HERE.
 *
 * 1. Value moves only through a ledger recipe (Doctrine §0.6). This service
 *    holds no balance. What it holds is a payment id, a merchant id, and an
 *    opinion about what should happen next.
 *
 * 2. Idempotency keys are business keys. `payment.capture:<paymentId>`,
 *    `settlement:<merchantId>:<window>:<assetId>`. A PSP webhook WILL be
 *    delivered twice; that is normal, not exceptional, and every path here is
 *    written on the assumption that it already has been.
 *
 * 3. Every transition appends to `payment_events`. Nothing is overwritten —
 *    the database enforces it with a trigger. `payments.status` is a
 *    projection; the event log is the truth, and it is what the captured and
 *    refunded totals are computed from rather than a column that could drift.
 *
 * ORDERING, AND WHOSE FUNDS ARE STRANDED IF THIS CRASHES EXACTLY HERE.
 *
 * The rule that decides operation order is the direction of the money:
 *
 *   INBOUND  (capture) — the rail moves first, the ledger books second. We only
 *                        ever book value we know has arrived. A crash between
 *                        them leaves money at the rail that is not yet in the
 *                        book: the classic "captured but not settled". Nothing
 *                        is lost, because both halves are idempotent on the
 *                        payment id and re-running finishes the job.
 *
 *   OUTBOUND (refund, payout) — the LEDGER moves first, the rail second. The
 *                        merchant must be shown to have the money before any of
 *                        it is sent somewhere irreversible. A crash between them
 *                        leaves the book correct and a status projection behind,
 *                        which is a reporting problem, not a money problem.
 *
 * Getting those two the wrong way round is how a gateway sends a refund out of
 * a balance that could not cover it.

   *   decision rather than an oversight. A use is consumed by a completed
   *   payment; a completed payment against a merchant's own link is revenue. The
   *   merchant who is issuing an invoice sets `maxUses: 1` and gets single-use
   *   semantics; the merchant running a tip jar does not, and should not have to.

   *
   *   REVOCATION is `deactivatePaymentLink`, and it is one-way. There is no

  //
  // THIS IS THE ONLY PUBLIC, UNAUTHENTICATED, VALUE-BEARING SURFACE IN THE
  // SERVICE. Everything below assumes the caller is hostile until proven
  // otherwise, and the design rules that follow from that are:
  //
  //   1. THE BROWSER DECIDES NOTHING THAT COSTS MONEY. The amount is frozen on
  //      the server at open and never re-read from a request. The rail is chosen
  //      from configuration and is never named by the caller — a hosted checkout
  //      that can name a rail is the route straight back to the P0 that
  //      `rails/posture.ts` closed.
  //   2. THE RAIL SAYS WHEN IT IS PAID, NOT THE PAGE. A session completes only
  //      when the payment behind it reaches `captured`, which happens on a
  //      verified webhook or an operator-driven capture. There is no
  //      "confirm payment" the payer can call.
  //   3. NOTHING IS FABRICATED. If no rail can honestly accept a public payment
  //      on this deployment, opening the session is REFUSED before any row is
  //      written and the payer is never shown a checkout that cannot complete.
  //   4. THE SESSION EXPIRES; THE PAYMENT DOES NOT. See `getCheckoutSession`.

  /**
   * Open a checkout session against a payment link. PUBLIC — the link token is
   * the capability, exactly as it is for `resolvePaymentLink`.
   *
   * ORDER OF OPERATIONS, AND WHY:
   *
   *   0. Choose a rail and check the posture. FIRST, before a row exists,
   *      because a refusal here must cost nothing and leave nothing behind.
   *   1. Lock the link, validate it, count open sessions, freeze the amount,
   *      write the payment and the session — one transaction, no external calls.
   *   2. Ask the rail how this payer pays. OUTSIDE the transaction, because it
   *      is a network call and because a crash here is resumable: the session is
   *      committed with no instruction, and the next read fills it in.
   *
   * IF THE PROCESS DIES AFTER (1) AND BEFORE (2), whose money is stranded?
   * Nobody's. No payer has been handed anywhere to send funds yet, and no value
   * has moved on any rail. The session sits `open` with a null instruction and
   * the first `getCheckoutSession` completes it, because `authorize` is
   * idempotent on the payment id and the acceptance address is derived from it.

   * re-sent. The rail receives the durable `refundId` (M226-02) so live crypto

   *
   * Two phases, because the alternative silently loses money:
   *
   *   1. Freeze. The payment set is fixed by appending `settlement.included` to
   *      each payment, and gross/fees/net are computed and stored `pending`.
   *   2. Post. The ledger transaction uses the FROZEN numbers.
   *
   * If it were one phase, a crash between posting and committing would leave a
   * ledger transaction keyed `settlement:<merchant>:<window>:<asset>` for one
   * gross while a retry — now including a payment that landed in the meantime —
   * computed a different gross, posted it, and got the ORIGINAL transaction
   * back from the idempotency check. The database would then record a
   * settlement the ledger never made. Freezing first makes the retry
   * arithmetically identical.
   *
   * MERCHANT STATUS. Only an `active` merchant freezes a new window or posts
   * one. `createPayment` and public checkout already refuse non-active; until
   * this gate, a suspended merchant could still settle captured volume and take
   * it out via `payoutSettlement` — suspension that stopped inbound only.
   * Re-reading an already-posted settlement is still fine (no value moves).

 *   `completed` — so a redelivered webhook that re-runs capture does not count a
 *   second use against the link.
 *

 *   be the books and the checkout disagreeing about the same money.
 *

 *   that governs a deposit: money that has ALREADY ARRIVED must always be

 *   moved; enforcing it here would mean refusing to record value sitting at an
 *   address we control, and stranding it is a far worse outcome than a merchant
 *   taking one payment past their own ceiling.

 * open sessions at the same instant on a `maxUses: 1` link can both pay, and
