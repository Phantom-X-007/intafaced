 * `tsconfig.json` includes only `src/**`, so nothing here is compiled into
 * `dist/` and nothing here can be imported by the running service. `env.ts`
 * states that svc-protocol holds no signing key of any kind; that statement
 * stays true of the shipped service because the only key in this repository
 * sits in a file the service cannot reach.

 * Foundry, Hardhat and Ganache all print to the terminal on every start. It is
 * in their documentation, in thousands of repositories, and in every tutorial
 * ever written about local EVM development. Anyone can spend anything its
 * accounts hold on any chain, which is exactly why it must only ever touch a
 * chain whose entire state is disposable.
 *
 * `assertDisposableChain` below is what enforces that. It refuses to sign
 * anything unless the endpoint identifies itself as anvil/hardhat AND reports
 * the dev chain id. A fat-fingered `PROTOCOL_RPC_URL` pointing at a real
 * network gets a refusal, not a transaction.
 *
 * If you are reading this because you want to deploy for real: you do not want
 * this file. A production deployment is a key-management decision, made by a
 * human, with a key this repository has never seen.

/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * PER-SUITE SENDERS — WHY A HAND-PICKED ACCOUNT INDEX IS NOT A FIX
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Vitest runs test files in parallel workers, and `pnpm verify` runs packages
 * in parallel on top of that. Two files that send from the SAME account both
 * read `eth_getTransactionCount(pending)`, both get N, and both broadcast with
 * nonce N. One is mined; the other gets `nonce too low` — on a chain that is
 * behaving perfectly, in a file whose diff contains nothing wrong.
 *
 * The previous answer was a comment convention: every live-chain file picked a
 * different one of anvil's ten pre-funded accounts, and each file's header
 * recited which index the others had taken. That is a registry maintained by
 * copy-paste across three services, and it did what registries maintained by
 * copy-paste do. By the time this was written it had drifted into two silent
 * collisions — index 3 (`token-factory-onchain` + `pool-factory-onchain`) and
 * index 4 (`mint-swap-onchain` + `router-launch-live`) — plus a third across
 * services, svc-pay's live rail suite sending from indices 0 and 1 while
 * svc-protocol's `deploy-dev` and `create2-onchain` used the same two. It also
 * had a hard ceiling: ten accounts, and svc-protocol alone wants six.
 *
 * So the index is no longer picked. It is DERIVED from the suite's own path:
 *
 *   · Distinct files get distinct senders because distinct paths hash apart.
 *     Nothing to remember, nothing to keep in sync, no ceiling, and a new
 *     on-chain suite is isolated the moment it is written.
 *   · The derivation is stable across machines and CI (it keys off the path
 *     from `services/` down, not the checkout root), so a failure is
 *     reproducible and the sender is greppable from the address.
 *   · Two checkouts of the same file DO get the same sender. That is correct:
 *     they are the same suite, and running one repo twice at once against one
 *     dev chain is not a thing this promises to support.
 *
 * ── Why a whole other HD branch ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * anvil's ten pre-funded accounts are `m/44'/60'/0'/0/{0..9}`. Suite senders
 * live at `m/44'/60'/1'/0/{i}` — a different BIP-44 account, so the subtrees
 * are disjoint by construction rather than by staying below/above some agreed
 * number. A derived sender can never BE one of the ten, so `deploy-dev.ts`'s
 * nonce-0/1/2/3 CREATE addresses (which docker-compose.apps.yml names) stay
 * exactly as deterministic as they were. It is also disjoint from the deposit
 * addresses svc-pay derives from this same public mnemonic, which use the
 * default account branch.
 *
 * ── Why funding is a state write, not a transfer ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `m/44'/60'/1'/0/{i}` holds nothing at genesis, so it has to be funded. A
 * faucet TRANSFER would re-introduce exactly the bug being fixed: every suite
 * would race the faucet's nonce instead of the deployer's. `anvil_setBalance`
 * writes the balance directly — no transaction, no nonce, no sender, nothing
 * to race. It is an anvil-only method, which is the point: it cannot silently
 * work against a real node, and `devSuiteClients` calls
 * `assertDisposableChain` BEFORE it, so the throwaway-chain check is what
 * gates the state write rather than something that runs after it.
