## Verdict

**SAFE TO CLOSE this wave** for agent residual craft under the exclusive wall.

Wave 3 money top-10 held. Wave 4 shipped **claim unlock + real residual breaks** (TWAP cancel-fail / seed FX place / liq mark size / presentation honesty / docs) without inventing owner numbers.

## Merged this wave (named)

| PR | What a trader / operator can now rely on | Class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **#1215** | `svc-trade` no longer whole-locked by ghost `trade.futures @nitro-agent` or vault `module:trade` invent; claim-check module fallback only when `requires` empty | N |
| **#1220** | Seed production FX/commodity **cannot take a real hold** — place/convert/TWAP share `assertSettlementRails` | P |
| **#1222** | Liquidation marks pass **position size** (relative depth floor); `initialMargin` ≠ residual after funding | M |
| **#1223** | README: algo jobs mounted **default OFF**, not “dead code”; SIGTERM stops reconcile host | N |
| **#1219** | Failed TWAP cancel **pauses** (no more slices); resume refused until re-cancel (`cancel_incomplete`); `tickAll` isolates parents | M |
| **#1237** | Matching journal header honesty (replay-once ≠ live id guard) | N |

Re-derive merge list from `gh pr list --state merged --search "trade w4"` if tip moved.

## Engine A scoreboard (after wave 4)

| Prio | Unit | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A0 | Open trade / claim clear | **Done #1215** |
| A1 | copy mount | **PARK** — money sealed W3; still unmounted by design |
| A1 | OTC residual | **PARK owner** — mid max-age socket |
| A1 | MM residual | Sealed W3 size/age; sequenced-book residual still open (not shipped) |
| A1 | venue residual | Sealed public second venue; single-id mark mount |
| A2 | algo OFF respect | **#1219** cancel-fail + resume gate; jobs still OFF default |
| A2 | ccxt residual | Sealed 501s; no new hole |
| A2 | forex thin | **#1220** place refuse on unsettled class |
| A3 | matching falsify | **#1237** journal honesty; refuse table sealed |
| A3 | margin-call | Sealed W3 #1211 — no invent D3 |
| A3 | Engine B re-run | Harvest complete; new units above only |
| A3 | stop note T* table | **This file** |

## Parked (honest)

1. **Copy mount** — deliberate Class M + migration `copy_mirrored_fills` + §8 rates  
2. **OTC mid age** — owner max-age  
3. **TWAP principal durability** — socket (no mint)  
4. **Sequenced venue book for marks** — age-on-poll incomplete  
5. **Futures R1/R2** concurrent liq claim/lock — harvested, not shipped this wave  
6. **Funding block-next unsettled period** — ADR residual  
7. **leader_share_bps / leverage / venue keys** — Nitro-only

---

## Nitro must decide

- **N5** reflag seed FX markets public list (paper/pending) — place path now refuses anyway  
- **N1** `TRADE_FUTURES_PROFIT_SOURCE` capitalisation  
- Copy mount **go** if product wants routes  
- OTC mid max-age number  

Or **none** required to leave residual safe.

## Machine

- Worktrees: `feat-trade-w4-*` under `~/projects/sovereign-worktrees/`  
- Class M: self-audit + adversarial on #1219 / #1222  
- Local: 26/26 `twap-engine` tests green; CI seal on merges  
- Claim-check after #1215: `services/svc-trade` clear
