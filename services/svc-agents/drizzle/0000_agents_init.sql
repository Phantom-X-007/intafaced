-- svc-agents · initial schema (§8.2 — agent fleet runtime + model gateway)
-- Reversal: 0000_agents_init.down.sql
--
-- The "agents" schema itself is created by the database bootstrap
-- (tooling/infra/postgres-init/01-service-schemas.sql), which also grants it to
-- the svc_agents role. Migrations run as that role and hold no database-level
-- CREATE privilege, so a migration physically cannot reach outside its own
-- schema (§2).
--
-- Every statement is idempotent: this file is re-runnable, and constraints are
-- re-asserted with DROP ... IF EXISTS first so tightening one later is an edit
-- here rather than a new migration.
--
-- The two properties this file exists to make true regardless of application
-- code are:
--   1. `agent_actions` cannot be rewritten (append-only trigger).
--   2. Usage cannot be added to a settled billing window (seal trigger).
-- Both are enforced in the database because both are the kind of rule that a
-- service bug, a retry, or a future maintainer would otherwise be able to break
-- silently — one destroys an audit trail, the other bills a user twice.
