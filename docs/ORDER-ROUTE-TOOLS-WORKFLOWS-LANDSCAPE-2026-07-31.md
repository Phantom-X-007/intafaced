## 0 · Vibe coder vs professional (this program)

| Vibe coder | Professional (what we do) |
| --- | --- |
| “Ship PRs until it feels stable” | Spec REQs → Plan → TDD → **fresh** verify → money review |
| Unit tests only on happy path | Unit + **property** + **chaos catalog** + **assembled path** |
| Mock the world forever | In-process fakes for speed **and** real compose path for truth |
| Trust the builder chat’s “green” | Builder never grades self |
| Install every trendy agent framework | **Reuse monorepo law** + thin force-multipliers only |
| Chaos as theater (break prod) | Steady-state hypothesis + **dev/CI faults** from Spec §5 |
| Spec in chat memory | Spec as **contract** (REQ-IDs) in durable docs |
| Mark tracker done | Evidence links or residual named |

**Insane difference** comes less from one magic tool and more from **workflow law**: phase separation, REQ mapping, dual verify levels, dual-book scans, chaos catalog as tests.

## 1 · What we already have (use first — free leverage)

Do **not** replace these with fashionable alternatives.

| Asset | Role for this program | Professional use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`pnpm verify`** | Build + typecheck + test + DoD gate | Local merge seal; thrift law |
| **Vitest** (everywhere) | Unit + service tests | Primary runner; already huge trade/matching suites |
| **Doctrine scans** | brand / custody / vendor-shell / secrets / test-db | Dual-book enforcement **extends** these — not a new product |
| **`dod-gate.mjs`** | Definition of Done CI | Keep; money PRs must pass |
| **Worktrees (`pnpm wt`)** | Isolation | Mandatory per Build lane |
| **Tracker + LIVE-LANES** | Claim / collision | Program lanes claimed before code |
| **`platform:up` / compose** | Assembled fleet | Walking skeleton / CX-8 home |
| **`infra:up`** | Postgres, NATS, etc. | Integration truth |
| **Ledger recipes + memory ledger** | Money truth in tests | Prefer recipes over reinvent |
| **Matching FileJournal + determinism tests** | Engine recovery | Extend, don’t rewrite |
| **JetStream bus + memory bus** | Event recovery | Redelivery tests use real semantics |
| **Playwright uiproof** | Shell proof | Only when Stream A honesty collides (DX-9) |
| **Class M matrix + thrift** | Merge / CI economics | Non-negotiable |
| **Doubt-driven / review skills** | Fresh adversarial | Every Spec/Arch/money PR |
| **Grok/Claude multi-session** | Builder ≠ verifier | Session topology from Frame |

**Verdict:** We are not tool-poor. We are **workflow-incomplete** (chaos suite, dual-book scan depth, assembled path as first-class, Spec as gate).

## 2 · Landscape by job (what professionals use)

### 2.1 Spec / planning / agent orchestration

| Tool / workflow | What it is | Delta for us | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Our Spec v1 + Frame docs** | Durable REQ contract | Already started | **Adopt as SoT** |
| **GitHub Spec Kit** | specify→plan→tasks→implement + “constitution” | Good structure; risk of second process | **Adopt pattern only** — map to our docs; optional later install if agents thrash |
| **OpenSpec** | Delta specs, light brownfield | Fits iterative money residual | **Adopt pattern** (delta REQs in Spec changelog) — full install optional |
| **BMAD-METHOD** | Heavy multi-agent roles (21+) | Strong adversarial roles; high ceremony tax | **Reject full install**; steal “party mode / adversarial roles” as **spawned subagents** |
| **Doubt-driven development** | Fresh-context disproof | Already in Nitro system | **Adopt always** on non-trivial |
| **Superpowers writing-plans** | Bite-size TDD task graphs | Plan rung | **Adopt for Plan doc** |
| **Subagent-driven-development** | Fresh agent per task | Build | **Adopt for Build lanes** |
| **Verification-before-completion** | Evidence gate | Ship claims | **Adopt always** |

**Insane difference:** Spec Kit *ritual* does not beat a **REQ-ID → test → PR** chain enforced by agents. Constitution ≈ our doctrine + DIRECTION + Spec GC-*.

### 2.2 Unit & property testing (correctness)

| Tool | Use | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vitest** | Default | **Keep** |
| **fast-check** (+ `@fast-check/vitest`) | Property tests: conservation, idempotency, decimal invariants, concurrent schedules | **Adopt for CX/DB money invariants** — high leverage vs hand examples only |
| **Hand-crafted scenario suites** (existing trade-service tests) | Regression + doctrine stories | **Keep as gold** — property tests **add**, not replace |
| **Conformance suites** (ledger-client) | Recipe conservation | **Extend** for any new recipes (Denon carve-out) |

**Insane difference:** Property tests find double-release / float / ordering bugs that example tests miss.

### 2.3 Integration / assembled path (the usual failure)

| Tool | Use | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`platform:up` + scripted scenarios** | Real services, real NATS/PG | **Adopt as CX-8 primary** |
| **In-process multi-service harness** (trade + matching + memory ledger + memory bus) | Fast CI subset of chaos | **Adopt** as first chaos layer |
| **Testcontainers** (PG/NATS) | Ephemeral real deps in CI | **Adopt later** if compose flakes; not blocking if platform:up reliable |
| **Docker compose profiles** | Minimal order-path stack | **Adopt** if full platform too heavy for CI thrift |

**Insane difference:** Unit-green + assemble-red is the #1 professional shame. Spec already requires both levels.

### 2.4 Fault injection / chaos (stability under real money)

| Tool | Use | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Spec fault catalog F1–F8 as automated tests** | Steady state S; hypothesis; disprove | **Adopt first** (no SaaS needed) |
| **Toxiproxy** | Latency, timeout, connection cut between trade↔matching | **Adopt when** HTTP transport faults need realism beyond mocks |
| **Chaos Toolkit / Litmus / Gremlin** | Infra/K8s chaos | **Reject for now** — overkill pre-go-live; no K8s prod story |
| **Process kill / abort mid-handler** in tests | Crash windows | **Adopt** in harness (Node kill, thrown errors at seams) |
| **JetStream redelivery simulation** | At-least-once | **Adopt** using existing bus test patterns |

**Insane difference:** Catalog-as-code beats “we ran Gremlin once.” Principles of Chaos: steady state → inject → look for drift.

### 2.5 Contract testing (service seams)

| Tool | Use | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pact (CDC)** | Consumer/provider contracts | **Defer** — high setup; we control both sides; **typed clients + integration tests** cover most |
| **OpenAPI / tRPC procedure contracts** | Explicit wire shapes | **Strengthen** existing types + tests for matching client |
| **Event catalog** (`packages/events`) | Fill/cancel subjects | **Treat as contract** — break CI if fill payload drifts |

**Insane difference:** Event + client contracts matter more than full Pact in a single monorepo.

### 2.6 Dual-book / static money enforcement

| Tool | Use | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Extend `vendor-shell-scan` + `custody-scan`** | Ban DAO mutators; walk Java | **Adopt — top priority tool work** |
| **Semgrep / CodeQL custom rules** | Cross-language money patterns | **Adopt later** if scan scripts get fragile |
| **ripgrep inventory scripts** | One-time controller census | **Adopt** for DB-2 inventory |

**Insane difference:** Scans that fail CI beat another ADR paragraph. Denon already named this gap.

### 2.7 Performance / load (secondary for this program)

| Tool | Use | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **k6 / Artillery** | Load on place/cancel | **Defer** — stability & conservation first; latency vanity is non-goal |
| **Matching engine’s own determinism/replay** | Correctness under volume of ops | **Keep** |

### 2.8 Observability (operate rung)

| Tool | Use | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Existing **tracing** hooks in services | Spans on money ops | **Use** in assembled proofs when present |
| Full APM stack | Prod ops | **Human §8 / later** — scoreboard before APM theater |

### 2.9 UI honesty (edge of program)

| Tool | Use | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Playwright uiproof** | Shell dual-book labels, routePreview not as price | **Adopt only for DX-9 / dual-book UI honesty** |
| Manual Orca screenshots | Nitro-facing | When needed |

---

## 3 · Workflows that change how we work (more than tools)

### W1 — REQ-driven ship loop (mandatory)

```
REQ-ID → failing test (or scan red) → minimal code → verify piece →
fresh adversarial (Class M) → PR → assembled re-check if path touched →
scoreboard update
```

No PR without REQ-IDs in body.

### W2 — Builder / Verifier / Reviewer separation (mandatory)

| Role | Session | Allowed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Builder | Worktree chat | Implement claimed tasks |
| Verifier | Fresh | Run tests, platform path, report evidence only |
| Reviewer | Fresh | Money/security/bloat — not “does test pass” |

Same human chat only if **subagent** enforces role split.

### W3 — Walking skeleton first (mandatory sequencing)

Before large dual-book refactors *or* in parallel with scan work:

1. Assembled place→hold→match→fill under F1–F4  
2. Then hang dual-book / seed / multi-asset on a path we already walk  

### W4 — Chaos as experiments, not vibes

For each fault F*:

1. Define steady state S (Spec)  
2. Hypothesis: S holds  
3. Inject F* in harness  
4. Measure conservation / open-order consistency  
5. Disproof = bugfix PR  

### W5 — Dual-book enforcement workflow

1. Inventory Java money doors (script)  
2. Disable at door  
3. Scan-ban mutators  
4. custody-scan Java  
5. Fresh money review  
6. ADR Accepted on main (#272)  

### W6 — Thrift-compatible professional CI

- Heavy assemble/chaos: targeted jobs or local `platform:up` proof in PR body  
- Not every push runs full fleet if thrift requires — but **merge of path-touching money PRs requires evidence**  
- Docs-only paths stay paths-ignore friendly  

### W7 — Scoreboard as operate artifact

Axes green/red/residual with proof links. Language “ready for real money” never without human X axes named.

## 4 · Recommended toolchain for THIS program (decision table)

### Tier A — start immediately (high delta, low ceremony)

| Item | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Spec REQ-IDs in every PR | Contract |
| Vitest chaos suite F1–F8 (in-process + matching client faults) | Stability proof |
| Assembled script on `platform:up` or slim compose | CX-8 |
| Extend vendor-shell-scan + custody-scan (Java) | Dual-book |
| Fresh verify/review agents | Blind-spot law |
| fast-check on conservation / concurrent place | Property leverage |
| LIVE-LANES + worktrees | Collision |

### Tier B — when Tier A hits a wall

| Item | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| Toxiproxy between trade↔matching | Mocks lie about timeouts |
| Testcontainers PG/NATS | CI can’t rely on shared docker |
| OpenSpec/Spec Kit install | Agents ignore Spec docs |
| Semgrep money rules | Custom scans hard to maintain |
| k6 smoke | After conservation green |

### Tier C — reject for this program

| Item | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Full BMAD install | Ceremony > value; we can spawn roles |
| Gremlin/Litmus/prod chaos | Wrong altitude pre-go-live |
| Pact platform | Monorepo overkill now |
| HFT benchmark kits | Non-goal |
| New matching engine | Doctrine split already correct |
| Card/PCI or invent execute | Out of Spec |

## 5 · How this changes the Plan (preview)

Plan tasks must include explicit **tooling tasks**, not only product:

1. T-TOOLS-1: chaos harness package/location + F1–F4 green  
2. T-TOOLS-2: scan extensions for dual-book  
3. T-TOOLS-3: assembled path script + CI/local how-to  
4. T-TOOLS-4: fast-check properties for hold/fill idempotency  
5. Then product REQs (DB-*, SD-*, …)  

Professionals schedule **harness before mountain**.

## 6 · Mapping to Spec REQs (tools as first-class)

| Spec area | Primary tools/workflows |
| --- | --- |
| DB-* | Scan extend, inventory script, Class M review |
| CX-1–6 | Existing vitest (guard) |
| CX-7–9 | Chaos harness, platform:up, reconcile tests |
| DX-* | Vitest quote suite, optional Playwright DX-9 |
| SD-* | Seeder resume + volume tests |
| RS-* | Scoreboard doc + WAVE-AUDIT |
| GC / LW | Docs, #272, LIVE-LANES |
