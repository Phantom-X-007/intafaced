/**
 * MUTATION TEST for `secret-scan.mjs`.
 *
 * WHY A MUTATION TEST AND NOT A UNIT TEST
 *
 * A scanner that passes is indistinguishable from a scanner that is switched
 * off. `pnpm scan:secrets` printing a green tick proves nothing on its own —
 * `process.exit(0)` on line 1 would print the same tick. The A1.4 branch
 * (docs/A1.4-WALLET-SECRETS-PERIMETER-2026-07-30.md §4) handled this by hand:
 * a probe file with three planted credentials, run once, then deleted. That
 * proved the gate worked on the day it was written and nothing afterwards.
 *
 * This makes it repeatable. Each MUTANT is a small synthetic file with a known
 * defect planted in it. The scan runs against a throwaway git repository
 * containing that one file. A mutant is KILLED if the scan exits non-zero.
 *
 * Two corpora, and the second is the one that matters more:
 *
 *   · `catch: true`  — a real defect. Surviving means the gate is blind to a
 *     class of committed credential.
 *   · `catch: false` — correct code that is credential-SHAPED. Killing one of
 *     these is a false positive, and a gate that cries wolf gets disabled. This
 *     file's whole reason for existing is that the second number stays at zero
 *     while the first goes up.
 *
 * Mutants marked `knownGap: true` are expected to survive and are excluded from
 * the score. They are documented non-goals — printed every run so a gap has to
 * be re-read rather than forgotten. Silently scoring them as passes would be
 * the same dishonesty as exempting a path to make a build green.
 *
 * NO MUTANT CONTAINS A REAL CREDENTIAL. Every planted value is the literal
 * string `MUTANT-` plus filler. That is deliberate: a test corpus is a tracked
 * file like any other, and seeding it with realistic secrets to test a secret
 * scanner is how you end up with a secret in the repository.
 *
 * Usage:  pnpm scan:secrets:mutate
 * Exit 0 = every scored mutant behaved. Exit 1 = a survivor or a false positive.
