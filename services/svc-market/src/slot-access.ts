 * WHO MAY HOLD A LISTING SLOT (§8.7, `market.vendors` Stage 2).
 *

 * lifecycle status is, how many slots their stake tier entitles them to, and how
 * many they already hold. No I/O, so the rule is one function that the claim
 * path, the slot read and the tests below cannot drift apart on.
 *
 * ── THE ORDER OF THE CHECKS IS DELIBERATE ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The GATE is checked before the SLOT COUNT, the same inversion
 * `services/svc-academy/src/access/room-access.ts` makes and for the same
 * reason: telling somebody their tier is full when they were never eligible
 * sends them away to wait for capacity they could not have used. Telling them to
 * stake first is something they can act on.
 *
 * ── NO STAKE NUMBER APPEARS IN THIS FILE ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `capacity` arrives as a number that svc-token computed from its own tier table
 * (`economics/staking.ts`, `vendorSlots`). There is no threshold here, no tier
 * name compared against a constant, and nothing that would still work if
 * svc-token retuned the schedule. `docs/ops/trk/market.vendors.md:76`: "market
 * must not invent parallel stake numbers".

 *
 * ── WHY A DERIVED NUMBER RATHER THAN A RELEASE JOB ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A slot is released when a vendor is suspended, because svc-market records that
 * transition itself and can act on it in the same transaction (`vet`). Unstaking
 * is not like that: it happens inside svc-token, there is no accepted bus subject
 * for it, and `tooling/ci/event-wiring.mjs` correctly reds on a subject with no
 * publisher. Polling svc-token for stake changes would be a second source of
 * truth on a timer.
 *
 * So the honest mechanism is to re-derive on every read: a vendor who has
 * dropped from Operator (3 slots) to Base (0) holds three rows that count for
 * nothing the instant anybody asks. The slot rows are not a lie — they record
 * what was claimed — but ENTITLEMENT is always the live tier, never the row
 * count. Stage 3's public read consumes this, and cannot present a slot the
 * vendor's current stake does not cover.
 *
 * A suspended vendor is zero regardless, so a missed release cannot leave one
 * presenting as listed either.
