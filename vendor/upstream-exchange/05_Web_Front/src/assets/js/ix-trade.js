/**
 * svc-trade CCXT wire → the shapes the vendored desk already renders.
 *
 * WHY AN ADAPTER AND NOT A REWRITE. The trading screens in this shell are the
 * product (ADR 2026-08-02). Their layout, keyboard handling, error-summary
 * focus management and empty-state wiring are the valuable part and none of it
 * is wrong — what is wrong is that every one of them reads a dead Java backend.
 * So the wire changes and the presentation does not, and this file is the one
 * place the two vocabularies meet. A screen that translated inline would have
 * to be re-read line by line to answer "does this ever invent a number".
 *
 * THREE RULES, AND THEY ARE THE POINT
 *
 * 1. MONEY STAYS A STRING. Every price, amount, cost and fee arrives from
 *    svc-trade as a decimal string and leaves here as the same decimal string,
 *    byte for byte. Nothing in this file calls Number() on an amount. The desk
 *    does parse some of them for pixel arithmetic (bar widths, percent sizing)
 *    and that is display, not money — but the value that goes back out to
 *    `POST /api/v1/orders` is the string the user typed, never a round-tripped
 *    float. (Order-ticket float paths are owned by ix-money.js — see that
 *    file's header.)
 *
 * 2. ABSENT IS NOT ZERO. Our ticker publishes `null` for every 24h rollup
 *    because no windowed aggregation job exists, and `null` for last price when
 *    a market has never traded. Those come through as null and the desk prints
 *    a dash. Turning them into 0 would put a real-looking number on a screen
 *    that has no idea what the price is, which is the single easiest way for
 *    this platform to tell a lie.
 *
 * 3. EMPTY IS AN ANSWER. `[]` from `/orderbook`, `/trades`, `/ohlcv` or
 *    `/orders/open` means the venue answered and there is nothing there. It is
 *    NOT a failure and must never be rendered as one — no spinner, no "did not
 *    respond". The books are empty today and that is the true state of the
 *    market. The callers set `reachable = true` on an empty array on purpose.
 *
 * 4. SHAPE BEFORE ADAPT. Call sites that read a live REST body run `accept()`
 *    with a schema from `ix-wire.js` BEFORE any `toDesk*` / `toPlate*` /
 *    `toMarket*` adapter. A float price, a 19dp amount or a custodial:true
 *    health answer becomes `invalid_response` naming the field — it never
 *    reaches a form, a ladder or a sovereignty badge.
 *
 * CommonJS so the golden tests can require() it without a bundler, matching
 * book-honesty.js and desk-prefs.js beside it.
