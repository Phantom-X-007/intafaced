# Graph AFK status — for Nitro when you return

**When written:** 2026-07-27  
**What you asked:** Run the graph on everything **except Denon’s spine**; come back when finished.

---

## Verdict now

**Foundation graph is moving — three PRs open.** Not entire brokerage program finished yet (Wave-2+ product slices still pending; Denon still owns holds).

### Open PRs (graph)

| PR | What | Merge note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[#45](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/pull/45)** | Tracker honesty (no rebuilds) | Safe docs/tracker |
| **[#46](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/pull/46)** | Core mount (identity + ledger + token) | Money-adjacent — **Denon should merge** |
| **[#47](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/pull/47)** | Trade mount (`/trpc`) | Money-adjacent — **Denon should merge**; best after #46 |

### Denon still owns (not us)

- Mount boundary stamp  
- **Purpose-keyed holds**  
- Soft-launch ledger harden (freeze / idempotency / fee rule)  

### Still graph-pending after foundation merges

- `ws.gateway`  
- `trade.convert`  
- `web.terminal`  
- then MM / venues surface work / etc. per program

## What “finished” means here

| Level | Done |
| --- | --- |
| **This AFK session milestone** | Graph foundation claims W1-T/C/R → **PRs open** with verify |
| **Foundation complete** | #45–#47 **merged** (money ones by Denon) |
| **Safe real deploy** | Denon holds + harden merged too |
| **Brokerage product “wave empty”** | Wave-2+ freeze rows terminal |

Live status file: `docs/AUTONOMOUS-RUN.md` (on PR #45 branch until merged).

## What you do when back

1. Open the three PR links.  
2. Ask Denon to merge #46/#47 after his review (or you explicit).  
3. Confirm Denon holds progress.  
4. Say **continue graph** for Wave-2 (ws / convert / terminal).
