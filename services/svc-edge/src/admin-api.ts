/**
 * THE OPERATOR CONTROL SURFACE (§14.6) — what `apps/admin` reaches.
 *
 * Mounted at `/admin/*`, deliberately OUTSIDE `/api/*`: nothing here is
 * proxied, and the catch-all proxy must never be the thing that decides whether
 * an admin path is real. `resolve()` returns null for `/admin/...` and an
 * unlisted prefix is a 404, so these routes have to be registered explicitly —
 * which is the property that keeps `/admin` from ever becoming a pass-through.
 *
 * ── Authentication: the platform's own tokens, not a shared operator key ────
 *
 * The obvious shortcut is a static `ADMIN_CONTROL_SECRET` header. It was
 * rejected: a static secret has no subject, so the audit line for the most
 * consequential action in the platform would read "somebody with the key", and
 * rotating it means restarting the edge — during an incident, which is when the
 * key is most likely to have been in a screenshot.
 *
 * The edge already holds `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, because verifying user tokens is
 * its entire job. So an operator presents the same kind of token every other
 * caller presents, and it is checked with the same guards every service uses.
 *
 * ── Two scopes, because there are two different authorities here ────────────
 *
 *   · `admin:write` — halt a module. No user session carries it;
 *     `defaultScopes()` in svc-identity does not list it, `SESSION_SCOPES`
 *     excludes every `admin:*` scope, and `assertDelegatableScopes` refuses to
 *     mint an API key with one.
 *
 *     `requireMfa` is applied locally, exactly as `kyc.approve` does it and for
 *     the same stated reason: `admin:write` is not in `INTERACTIVE_ONLY_SCOPES`
 *     (whose membership test is "does this move value OFF the platform"), but a
 *     switch that can stop the exchange is a privilege whose leak must cost a
 *     second factor. Arguing the shared list should grow belongs in its own PR
 *     (§15.2).
 *
 *   · `admin:treasury` — the ledger freeze, and anything else that touches the
 *     money plane. Already in `INTERACTIVE_ONLY_SCOPES`, so `requireScope`
 *     enforces MFA by itself and no local check is needed.
 *
 * Halting one market and halting all value movement platform-wide are not the
 * same authority and must not share a credential. An operator on the trading
 * desk needs the first; the second is the switch `flags.ts` calls "the most
 * consequential in the platform", and `svc-ledger` gates it on `admin:treasury`
 * on its own side too. Checking it here as well is not redundancy for its own
 * sake — it means the edge refuses before it forwards a token, so an
 * under-scoped operator never reaches the money plane at all.
 *
 * Mutate of `/admin/kill-switches` is dual-control: the signed `admin:write`
 * principal plus a distinct `confirmOperatorId`. Missing or same-as-operator
 * confirm refuses (`missing_operator`) — one operator cannot kill or resume a
 * module. Matching halt and ledger freeze already require the same pair; a
 * one-operator kill-all at this door would be the same lie as a one-operator halt.
 * GET stays single-operator (read is not mutate).
 *
 * The token names a user, so every flip is attributable. The confirmer is a
 * named identity on the body; the edge does not invent a second caller.
 */

/**
 * Why this module cannot be armed from here, or null if it can.
 *
 * ── The bug this closes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The refinement below used to be `isModuleId` alone: every one of the 23
 * `MODULE_IDS` was accepted, while the edge can only enforce the 13 that have a
 * prefix in the route table. The other ten were armable and unenforceable — a
 * halt that returned 200, showed up in `disabledModules`, appeared in the audit
 * trail as a real event, and refused nothing.
 *
 * `ws` was the one that mattered: svc-ws is deployed, publishes 4014, and the
 * browser talks to it directly. An operator halting the market data socket
 * during an incident got a green console and a live socket.
 *
 * A kill-switch the operator can arm but the platform cannot enforce is worse
 * than an absent one, for the same reason a check that fails open is: the
 * failure is invisible precisely when it is being relied on. So the control
 * plane now refuses, and says which control to reach for instead.
