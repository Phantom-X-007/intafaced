# SPEC v1 — Order-route / DEX–CEX money-path harden

**Status:** SPEC STANDS · contract for Build  
**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Phase:** Rung 2 complete → Architect + Plan done → **Build starts at Plan P0→P1-1**  
**Parents:**  
- Frame + method: `docs/ORDER-ROUTE-FRAME-AND-PLANNING-METHODOLOGY-2026-07-31.md`  
- **Tools/workflows landscape:** `docs/ORDER-ROUTE-TOOLS-WORKFLOWS-LANDSCAPE-v2-2026-07-31.md` (Tier A mandatory in Plan; last30days + star map)  
- Domain inventory: `docs/ORDER-ROUTE-HARDEN-PROGRAM-2026-07-31.md`  
- Law: doctrine · agent protocol · ownership · Denon DIRECTION (#272)  

**How to use:** Every Build task must map to at least one **REQ-ID** below. Verify proves REQs. No REQ → out of scope or needs Spec amend.

**Altitude rule:** This is **what must be true** (checkable). It is **not** the implementation plan (task order / files). Plan = next rung after Architect notes on open seams.

---

## 0 · Phase map (for Nitro — what you’re looking at)

| Phase | Artifact | You look for | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1 Frame** | Methodology + outcome | What / why / done-outcome / how we run | Working (this program) |
| **2 Spec** | **This file** | Checkable REQs — security, money, failure, out-of-scope | Adversarial pass + no holes on named board |
| **3 Architect** | Mini design notes (only hard seams) | 2–3 options + pick + failure modes | Seams decided for dual-book, chaos harness, seed model |
| **4 Plan** | Task graph (decompose) | Ordered pieces, each with a check, walking skeleton first | Complete vs Spec (every REQ has a task) |
| **5 Build** | PRs / worktrees | One concern, TDD money paths | Code exists |
| **6 Verify** | Fresh agent evidence | Tests + assembled path green | Proof you can see (links/output) |
| **7 Review** | Fresh agent | Money / security / bloat | Issues fixed or accepted trade-off |
| **8 Ship** | Merge | CI + Class matrix | On main |
| **9 Operate** | Scoreboard / WAVE-AUDIT | Green-red axes; go-live still human | Living |

**Spec vs Plan (one line):**  
**Spec** = *what must be true and how we know.*  
**Plan** = *in what order, which files, which tests first, which PR cuts.*  
You are looking at **Spec now**. Plan comes after Spec stands + Architect for ambiguous seams.

## 1 · Problem statement (Spec altitude)

INTAFACED’s spot CEX order path and DEX quote plane exist and are partially strong. They are **not** yet proven “stable under real-money conditions” because:

1. A second book can still exist in vendored Java money surfaces (dual-book not enforced).  
2. Failure/recovery paths between trade ↔ matching ↔ ledger ↔ bus are not fully proven as an **assembled** system under chaos.  
3. DEX can quote honestly but must never invent execute/fills; residual quote integrity still has holes (rate-limit, audit fields).  
4. Market depth for real trading surfaces needs seed/mm with **honesty**, without futures-first product invent.  
5. Go-live remains human; agents must not claim it.

**Success:** Denon (and Nitro) can trust a **readiness scoreboard** that the above are closed or explicitly residual with proof.

---

## 2 · Actors & planes

| Actor | Plane | Allowed money motion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User via trade:write | Fiat / CEX (`svc-trade`) | Hold / fill / release via ledger recipes only |
| Matching engine | None (no balances) | Match funded orders only |
| DEX quote caller | Protocol | Quotes only; no platform custody of user funds on protocol path |
| Seed/mm bot | Fiat book | Seeded orders flagged; kill-switchable |
| Java vendored controllers | Must not be a second book | Disabled at door / mutators banned |

---

## 3 · Global constraints (every REQ inherits these)

| ID | Constraint |
| --- | --- |
| **GC-1** | Money only via `packages/ledger-client` recipes; no balances outside ledger; no money as JS `number` on wire/storage of value. |
| **GC-2** | No vendor/partner names in user-facing copy (brand-scan). |
| **GC-3** | Class M merge: green CI + self-audit + adversarial; **carve-outs stay Denon** — external value out, scope grants, **new/changed ledger recipes**, posture/kill/custody scan changes. |
| **GC-4** | Denon §8 never agent-closed: go-live, secrets, prod RPC, listing policy, fee recipes invent, sanctions content, leverage params beyond defaults, “audited/insured” claims. |
| **GC-5** | Engine product order: **seed/mm → multi-asset → futures → OTC → TWAP**. Futures engine not started as a program mountain until seed + multi-asset bars in this Spec. Futures **recipes** already on main are OK; **engine MVP** is not this Spec’s early path. |
| **GC-6** | Worktree only; never main checkout; one concern per PR; `pnpm verify` real; CI thrift (local green before push storms). |
| **GC-7** | Builder never grades own work — Verify/Review fresh session or fresh agent. |
| **GC-8** | Stream A shell craft: coordinate LIVE-LANES; do not steal Wave A UI PRs for unrelated polish. |
| **GC-9** | Tracker honesty: never `done` without reachable + tested + unpropped. |
| **GC-10** | Live git wins over any frozen SHA in docs. |

---

## 4 · Requirements (checkable)

### 4.1 Dual-book (Option B)

| REQ | Requirement | Acceptance (how we know) | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **DB-1** | `ledger.*` is the only balance of record for platform money. | Written enforcement: no live write path to `member_wallet` (or equivalent) from money controllers; ADR dual-book **Accepted** on main. | M / posture |
| **DB-2** | All vendored money controllers that mutate balances are **disabled at the door** (unreachable), not merely unused. | Attempted call path returns refuse/disabled; inventory of controllers listed in PR body; count ≥ Denon’s “25” class or current audit count. | M / posture |
| **DB-3** | Four DAO mutators (`increaseBalance`, `decreaseBalance`, `freezeBalance`, `thawBalance` or exact Java names) are **hard-banned by scan**. | `vendor-shell-scan` fails CI if patterns reappear. | P/M |
| **DB-4** | `custody-scan` (or successor) **reads Java** under vendor money paths, not only TS. | Scan reports Java files scanned; fails on forbidden balance mutators / ledger bypass. | P |
| **DB-5** | Projection (if any) of balances into shell tables is **read-only** from ledger truth — never reverse. | Doc + test or scan proof; no write recipe from Java into ledger invent. | M |

### 4.2 CEX order route (spot) — behavior already partly true; Spec forces residual proof

| REQ | Requirement | Acceptance | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CX-1** | Order funding order is hold **before** matching sees the order. | Existing unit tests remain green; no regression. | M |
| **CX-2** | Same `clientOrderId` (per user/market) is exactly-once for place: one order, one hold key. | Concurrent + retry tests green. | M |
| **CX-3** | Fill settle is idempotent on engine business key (re-delivery safe). | Redelivery test green. | M |
| **CX-4** | Cancel after partial fill releases **only** remainder once. | Double-release trap tests green. | M |
| **CX-5** | Kill-switch / market halt: new places refuse; **cancel still works**. | Tests green. | M |
| **CX-6** | Engine transport failure after hold: order stays open with hold; recovery path is cancel (404 → full release if never live). | Unit test for indeterminate + **documented/automated reconcile** path. | M |
| **CX-7** | **Chaos suite (new):** inject at least the fault catalog in §5; steady state conserved. | Dedicated test module green in CI (or nightly with explicit gate). | M |
| **CX-8** | **Assembled path:** trade + matching + ledger (+ bus if events used) under one integration harness or platform:up script — not unit-only. | Integration proof command documented; green evidence in Verify. | M |
| **CX-9** | Open-order ↔ ledger hold ↔ engine live **reconcile** is defined (job or operator procedure with tests for happy/orphan cases). | Spec’d states + tests for at least: orphan pending, open+hold no engine, open+engine no hold (fail closed). | M |
| **CX-10** | Matching recovery: journal-first; process restart rebuilds book without emitting duplicate economic effects on bus consumers (idempotent consumers). | Existing determinism tests + consumer idempotency remain green. | M |
| **CX-11** | clientOrderId policy: uniqueness rules documented (recommend day-scope or global unique constraint); retries without id documented as unsafe. | Doc + optional DB uniqueness if already partial. | P |
| **CX-12** | No stop-order funding without solved design (current refuse remains or Spec amend). | Existing refuse stays unless Spec v2. | — |

### 4.3 DEX plane

| REQ | Requirement | Acceptance | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **DX-1** | Live `quote` only from sourced venues; never caller-supplied prices as “quote.” | Existing tests + no regression of invent path. | P |
| **DX-2** | Stale / future clock / no venue → machine-readable refuse, not guess. | Tests green. | P |
| **DX-3** | Multi-venue degrade/singleVenue disclosed; never claim best-of-N when one answered. | Tests green. | P |
| **DX-4** | Effective price routing (fees + settlement cost), not headline-only. | Tests green. | P |
| **DX-5** | Every adapter `submit` **throws / refuses** — no synthetic fills. | Tests green; code path audited. | M ban |
| **DX-6** | Quote response includes audit fields sufficient for later TCA: venues configured, venues used, ages, effective prices, degraded flags (extend if missing). | Schema + tests. | P |
| **DX-7** | Rate-limit / 429 from venue: degrade to unavailable, not stale invent. | Test with fake venue. | P |
| **DX-8** | Plane/custodial disclosure retained on venues. | Tests/docs. | P |
| **DX-9** | Shell must not render `routePreview` as a live price (coord Stream A if needed). | Honesty check or issue + fix. | N/P |

### 4.4 Seed books / mm-bot (Denon #1 engine order)

| REQ | Requirement | Acceptance | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SD-1** | Seeded liquidity can rest on markets used by product surfaces. | Seed path works on tip (resume seeder / bot as needed). | eng |
| **SD-2** | Every seeded order **flagged** in data model **and** API response. | Field present; test. | M product |
| **SD-3** | Seeded volume **excluded** from user-facing 24h volume / any “real activity” stat. | Test: seed trades do not inflate public volume. | M |
| **SD-4** | Bot killable via kill-switch surface like other routes. | Test. | M |
| **SD-5** | Bot does not manufacture unfair crosses that invent fills users would not get (liquidity provision only; tape-provable). | Written rule + test or tape assertion. | M |
| **SD-6** | Mongo/driver pin for vendored seeder stack fixed if seeder depends on it (OP_QUERY vs mongo:6). | Seeder boots or residual named with Denon spine resume proof. | eng |

### 4.5 Multi-asset (Denon #2)

| REQ | Requirement | Acceptance | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MA-1** | Resume `feat/multi-asset-instruments` (rebase), not greenfield rewrite. | PR from rebased branch. | eng |
| **MA-2** | Additive: existing spot suite unchanged behavior. | Spot suite green identical. | M |
| **MA-3** | Missing trading schedule entry → **refuse**, not throw. | Test. | P |
| **MA-4** | Forex/commodities not listed as production-tradable without rails (honest refuse/socket). | Config/listing guard or doc + refuse. | product law |

### 4.6 Adjacent money (same real-money story)

| REQ | Requirement | Acceptance | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PY-1** | Crypto broadcast durable across process death (claim→put journal). | Tests; Denon §3 #1. | M |
| **PY-2** | No merchant scope invent; no card scaffold; no go-live. | PR scope check. | ban |

### 4.7 Futures / other engines (explicit bounds)

| REQ | Requirement | Acceptance | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FT-1** | No futures **engine** MVP claim in this program’s early ships. | Tracker not `done` for futures engine. | ban early |
| **FT-2** | If later futures work starts: Denon six MVP conditions mandatory (isolated only, insurance, gap liq, etc.). | Future Spec v2. | — |
| **FT-3** | Copy trading not scaffolded. | Grep/scan clean of new copy product. | ban |
| **FT-4** | Algo v1 = TWAP only if ever started; icebergs out. | Scope check. | ban |

### 4.8 Security / custody / ops (invisible REQs)

| REQ | Requirement | Acceptance | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SC-1** | Protocol plane services do not import ledger write surface (existing custody-scan). | CI green. | P |
| **SC-2** | trade:withdraw never on API keys (existing INTERACTIVE_ONLY). | No regression. | M |
| **SC-3** | Sub-account ownership fail-closed before hold. | Existing tests green. | M |
| **SC-4** | Secrets / prod RPC / kill-drill sign-off **listed on scoreboard as human**, never agent-green. | Scoreboard axes. | X |
| **SC-5** | WAVE-AUDIT after every 3–4 product money ships. | Archive linked. | N |

### 4.9 Readiness scoreboard

| REQ | Requirement | Acceptance | Class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **RS-1** | Durable scoreboard doc (or section) with axes: Dual-book · CEX chaos · CEX assemble · DEX honesty · Seed honesty · Multi-asset · Pay durable · Human X items. | Each axis green/red/residual + proof link. | N |
| **RS-2** | “Stable for real money” language never used without all agent axes green **and** human X residual named. | Doc wording. | N |

### 4.10 Law / orientation

| REQ | Requirement | Acceptance | Class |

| **LW-1** | Denon DIRECTION (#272) on main (or tip equivalent). | Merged PR. | N |
| **LW-2** | LIVE-LANES claims `order-route-harden` (+ subsystem lanes). | Board updated. | ops |
| **LW-3** | Residual campaign R6 order pointer corrected to seed-first. | Doc patch. | N |

---

## 5 · Chaos fault catalog (CX-7)

Steady state **S**: after operations, ledger closed (conservation), no double hold/fill/release, open orders reconcilable.

| Fault ID | Injection | Expected |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | Concurrent place same clientOrderId | One order, one hold |
| F2 | Fill event redelivered N times | One tradeFill |
| F3 | Cancel after partial + redelivery | One remainder release |
| F4 | Matching HTTP fail after hold | Open+hold; cancel recovers |
| F5 | Trade dies after engine accept before settle | Recovery consumer settles once |
| F6 | Matching restart mid-book | Replay consistent; no double economic settle |
| F7 | Kill-switch mid-day | Place refuse; cancel ok |
| F8 | Seed + real user tape | Seed flagged; public volume honest |

Hypothesis: **S holds under F1–F8** in CI/dev. Disproof = failing test.

---

## 6 · Explicit out of scope (this Spec)

- Production go-live flip  
- HFT latency rewrite / replace matching engine  
- DEX cross-venue **execute** (svc-execution §28)  
- Copy trading, icebergs, cross-margin  
- Invent fee recipes, listing policy, sanctions content  
- Claiming protocol.amm or smart-accounts `done` on anvil-only proof  
- Stream A visual retheme (Wave B+) unless honesty collision  
- Third-builder reassignment  

---

## 7 · Priority order (Spec sequencing — not full Plan)

Must inform Plan; do not skip:

1. **LW-*** law on tip + lanes  
2. **DB-*** dual-book enforce (silent money risk)  
3. **CX-7/8/9** chaos + assemble + reconcile (prove path)  
4. **DX-*** residual DEX honesty  
5. **SD-*** seed honesty (Denon #1)  
6. **MA-*** multi-asset resume  
7. **PY-*** durable broadcast if still open  
8. **RS-*** scoreboard + WAVE-AUDIT  

Walking skeleton for Build: **CX assemble + F1–F4 minimum** early so later dual-book/seed hang on a proven path.

---

## 8 · Class M / Denon carve-out handling

| Change type | Agent may merge? |
| --- | --- |
| Tests only proving existing recipes | Yes (after gates) |
| New chaos harness without recipe change | Yes |
| Scan bans / controller door-kill | **Carve-out risk** — prepare PR + adversarial; if classified posture/custody, **hold for Denon or explicit merge-when-green** |
| New ledger recipe | **No** without Denon |
| External rail value out | **No** without Denon |

When in doubt: treat as carve-out, draft ask, do not silent-merge.

---

## 9 · Verify matrix (two levels)

| Level | What |
| --- | --- |
| Piece | Each PR’s unit/integration tests for its REQs |
| Assembled | CX-8 path green under F-subset |
| Program | RS-1 all agent axes green or residual named |

No evidence = not done. Fresh Verify agent for money ships.

---

## 10 · Completeness checklist (Spec self-audit)

- [x] Dual-book  
- [x] CEX happy + residual + chaos + assemble + reconcile  
- [x] DEX quote + no execute  
- [x] Seed honesty  
- [x] Multi-asset  
- [x] Pay adjacent  
- [x] Futures/copy bounds  
- [x] Security/ops human X  
- [x] Scoreboard  
- [x] Law/lanes  
- [x] Out of scope  
- [x] Fault catalog  
- [x] Class M rules  
- [x] Phase map Spec vs Plan  

**Next after this Spec stands:** Architect notes (dual-book shape, chaos harness home, seed model) → **Plan** (task graph with files/tests) → Build lanes.
