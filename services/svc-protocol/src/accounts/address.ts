/**
 * DETERMINISTIC ADDRESS DERIVATION (§17.4).
 *
 * A user is shown their smart account address during onboarding, before any
 * transaction exists and before anyone has paid for a deployment. This file is
 * what makes that promise true off-chain, and it must agree with
 * `AccountFactory.getAddress` byte for byte — if it does not, we show a user an
 * address, they fund it, and the funds sit at a contract that never appears.
 *
 * The account is an EIP-1167 minimal proxy, so the creation code is fully
 * determined by the implementation address. No compiler output is needed to
 * derive an address, which is the reason the account is a clone rather than an
 * ERC-1967 proxy — and, more importantly, the reason it can never be upgraded.
