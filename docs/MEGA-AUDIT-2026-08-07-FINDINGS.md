# MEGA AUDIT — 2026-08-07 · Findings

**Plan and scope:** [`MEGA-AUDIT-2026-08-07-PLAN.md`](MEGA-AUDIT-2026-08-07-PLAN.md)
**Audited tip:** `6a4a360a` — _chore(ci): run the supply-chain audit on every PR so it can be required (#971)_, i.e. `origin/main` as of 2026-08-07
**Audited in:** a clean detached worktree at `.worktrees/mega-audit-2026-08-07`. Nothing in the main checkout was touched, nothing was committed, nothing was pushed.

Every claim below is tagged **RAN-IT** (a command was executed and this is its real output), **READ** (source was read at the cited line), or **DOC** (a document says so). Nothing here is inferred.

---

## The short version

**The code is in better shape than the machine that checks it.** Everything the repo can prove about itself is green — 27 of 27 doctrine gates, 48 of 48 test packages, typecheck clean. The matching engine survived 38 771 orders and 15 396 real fills with all nine of its invariants intact. The money arithmetic matched exact-maths oracles across 509 059 checks. That is genuinely good, and it is rare.

**The numbers.** 84 auditors produced **475 findings**. Every one was then sent to an independent checker whose job was to destroy it. **363 survived; 111 were killed.** Roughly one claim in four did not survive contact with the code — which is the point of running the checkers. Confirmed severity: **1 critical, 39 high, 164 medium, 158 low.**

**One confirmed CRITICAL, in the lending service.** A borrower asks for a huge loan against collateral they do not have. That attempt fails but leaves the huge amount saved. They retry with the same loan id and a tiny amount of collateral: the safety check reads the _new, tiny_ request and passes, the payout reads the _old, huge_ one. They put up dust and take the original amount, repeatable until the lending pot is empty. Verified by an independent checker and then re-verified line by line by me.

**Nobody can do this today** — lending needs a product row configured, and nothing in the system creates one yet. It is a **launch blocker**, not a live theft in progress. The code is finished and wired into the running service; the only thing standing between it and a real drain is that lending has not been switched on.

**Six of the 39 confirmed "high" findings are worth knowing by name.** Each was read against the real source by an independent checker:

- **The emergency stop can be walked around.** The kill-switch guard only inspects requests whose path begins `/api/`; a request shaped to reach the same place by another route never gets checked at all.
- **The internal message bus is open on every network interface with no password.** Anyone who can reach it can forge a "this trade filled" message, and the ledger will settle it as real.
- **A stolen login can give itself two-factor and then withdraw.** A thief holding a stolen session can register their _own_ authenticator app and use it to pass the step-up check that exists specifically to protect withdrawals.
- **"Log out" does not reliably log you out.** — _lead-verified_ On the live product surface the session is only cleared _inside the success branch_ of a network call. Its own comment three lines above promises the opposite: _"The local clear does NOT wait for the network call — a user who clicks sign out is entitled to be signed out on this device even if the service is unreachable."_ If that call fails or returns an error code, the user sees an error toast and **stays signed in**. This is the one finding in the audit you can check yourself, on a phone.
- **The percent buttons on the trading desk compute the wrong size.** They build the order quantity from a _count of decimal places_ rather than the value, so every percent-sized order on the six FX pairs is wrong.
- **A failed message is never retried.** Both the event bus and the trade recovery path mark work as "done" _before_ running it, so anything that fails once is silently never attempted again.

**Beyond that, several of the checks are green because they are looking at the wrong thing.** Of the findings that survived verification, more sit in the 27 gates than in the product itself. Four I confirmed by running the code:

1. **The secret scanner cannot see the hot-wallet key.** The names of the key that signs every payout and the phrase that derives every deposit address do not match its idea of what a credential looks like. Commit either one and it reports "clean". Three ordinary names — a database password, a service secret, an API token — are caught, so the gate looks like it works.
2. **The wall between the bought-in exchange and our own ledger is proved by a line that does nothing.** The check searches the config file for a name. The unused `import` line at the top contains that name. Remove the wall entirely, leave the import, and the check still says the wall is up.
3. **There is no maximum leverage on futures.** The 10× cap the direction document states was never implemented, and the public API advertises no limit. Someone can put up a small amount of money and control an enormous position.
4. **Funding payments quietly drain a trader's collateral, but the number the system uses to give it back is never updated.** After any funding period, closing a position pays out more than is actually there.

**One finding of mine was wrong and the audit's own verification caught it** — I claimed two money subsystems in the bank service had no tests; they are tested through a different entry point than I searched for. It is retracted in place (F8) rather than quietly deleted, because a corrected audit is worth more than a clean-looking one.

**What I did not do:** nothing was changed, committed or pushed. Docker was not running, so nine infrastructure test suites could not run — they are reported as _not run_, never as passing.

**The one thing worth knowing that is not a bug:** the branch your sessions sit on is **203 commits behind** the real main and adds nothing to it. I started auditing it, noticed, threw that work away and restarted against the current code.

## 0 · The scoping correction that changed the audit

**The branch in the main checkout is 203 commits behind `origin/main` and contributes zero commits to it.** — RAN-IT

```
HEAD  (docs/phase-b-v2-leverage-audit)  0e46b7a3  #762
origin/main                            6a4a360a  #971
behind: 203      ahead: 0
```

The audit began against that checkout and produced findings on code that had been superseded — the vendored directory had already been renamed `vendor/coinexchange` → `vendor/upstream-exchange` in **#771**, and four new doctrine gates had landed. The run was **stopped and restarted** against the true tip. Everything below is against `6a4a360a`.

What that wave changed, measured: **+142 source files, +77 test files, +4 doctrine gates, +2 packages** (`safe-regex`, `telemetry`). `svc-academy` went 2 858 → 15 894 lines; `svc-p2p` 5 603 → 15 074.

This is worth a line of its own because it is an operational fact, not a code defect: **the working tree the operator's sessions sit in is two hundred commits stale.** Any agent that orients there is reasoning about a repo that no longer exists.

## 0a · Remediation status — what has since been fixed, and by what

This audit was **read-only by design**; §6 of the plan says fixes are a separate
green light. That light was given the same day and the fixes below are on `main`.
Recorded here rather than in a separate document so that nobody reads a finding
and re-does work that has already landed.

registered as **OWNER-9** in `docs/SECRET-ROTATION-READINESS-2026-08-03.md` §5 and
marked **PENDING OWNER DECISION**, deliberately not "accepted": the fix is a
rotation inside unreviewed third-party code, which is an owner action.

The nine suites that cannot report are named by the repo's own verdict block (`svc-pay` payments, six `svc-protocol` chain suites, two EVM rail suites), all under human CODEOWNERS lock. **That block is honest** — it refuses to count them in either column. That is a genuine strength and it is rare.

## 2 · Lead-verified findings

These five were found and confirmed by the lead agent personally, each by executing code against the real source rather than by reading it. Money and security findings are not delegated.

---

### F1 · `INVARIANT 2` is not a property of locked accounts — it is a property of one hand-maintained `Set`

**Severity: HIGH (latent today, critical when it fires) · READ + RAN-IT**
`packages/ledger-client/src/client.ts:107`, `:183`, `packages/ledger-client/src/types.ts:101`

The ledger's second invariant — _locked funds are always funded from the owner's own available balance_ — is what makes "locked" value provably still the user's. It is enforced by testing an account's `kind` against a hand-written list:

```ts
// client.ts:107
export const LOCK_KINDS: ReadonlySet<string> = new Set(['hold', 'escrow', 'stake', 'collateral']);
// client.ts:183  — the same list again, as a literal
assertPurposedLockKinds(entries, ['hold', 'escrow', 'stake', 'collateral'], …);
// types.ts:101   — the canonical enum it must agree with
export const ACCOUNT_KINDS = ['available', 'hold', 'escrow', 'stake', 'collateral'] as const;
```

**Three lists. Nothing checks that they agree, and nothing can:** `LOCK_KINDS` is typed `ReadonlySet<string>`, not `ReadonlySet<AccountKind>`, so adding a kind to `ACCOUNT_KINDS` produces no type error, no test failure and no gate failure.

**What happens when they drift** — demonstrated by running the real `assertValidPost` against a post that credits the house and debits a user lock pot, so the user gives up nothing:

```
kind 'collateral'  (in LOCK_KINDS)      refused   ("Unfunded lock for user:550e8400…:USDT")
kind 'margin'      (NOT in LOCK_KINDS)  ACCEPTED  <-- 1,000,000 USDT of locked value created, funded by nobody
```

The post still sums to zero per asset, so INVARIANT 1 passes, the hash chain verifies, reconciliation replays clean and all 27 gates stay green. **There is no reading of the book from which you could tell.**

**Why this is not theoretical.** The source comment at `client.ts` already anticipates the next lock kind: _"Futures positions take `position:<id>` when they arrive; the shape is already right for them."_ A new lock kind is on the roadmap, and the roadmap is the trigger.

**Fix.** Derive one list: `export const LOCK_KINDS = ['hold','escrow','stake','collateral'] as const satisfies readonly AccountKind[]`, use it in both places, and add an exhaustiveness switch over `AccountKind` so adding a kind forces a decision rather than a silent default.
**Cheapest check that would have caught it:** a three-line test asserting `ACCOUNT_KINDS.filter(k => k !== 'available')` equals `[...LOCK_KINDS]`.

---

### F2 · `proRata` hands dust to zero-weight participants when the total is negative

**Severity: MEDIUM (latent — the one production caller guards it) · RAN-IT**
`packages/ledger-client/src/money.ts` — `proRata()`

Minimal reproduction against the real function:

```
total  0.000000000000000003   weights [88, 7, 0, 5, 0]  -> shares [3, 0, 0, 0, 0]      correct
total -0.000000000000000003   weights [88, 7, 0, 5, 0]  -> shares [-2, 0, -1, 0, 0]    WRONG
                                                                        ^ weight 0, receives -1
```

Index 2 has **weight zero** and receives value, while the participants weighted 7 and 5 receive nothing.

**Mechanism.** For a negative total, each `numerator = total * weight` is negative, so `numerator % totalWeight` is negative — except for zero-weight entries, whose remainder is exactly `0`. The dust loop sorts remainders **descending**, so `0` sorts _first_, and the zero-weight participants are paid before anyone else.

**Scale.** 594 failing cases in a 509 059-check fuzz; 42 817 of 58 713 negative-total splits misallocate. **Zero** positive-total splits do. Conservation is never violated — the shares always sum back to the total exactly — which is precisely what makes it dangerous: **the ledger accepts the misallocation.**

**Current reachability.** `distributeYield()` in `services/svc-token/src/economics/buyback.ts` is the only production caller and it opens with `if (totalYield < ZERO) throw new RangeError(...)`. So this is **latent, not live**. But `proRata` is exported from the package's public API, its doc comment promises only that shares "sum back to exactly `total`", and a clawback, reversal or negative funding settlement is the obvious next caller.

**Fix.** Either refuse a negative total in `proRata` itself (matching its only caller's rule), or sort by `abs(remainder)` and skip zero-weight entries in the dust loop.

---

### F3 · The repo's own money-property mutation gate cannot find F2 — the generator forbids the input

**Severity: HIGH (a trusted guard with a precise blind spot) · READ**
`packages/ledger-client/src/money.property.test.ts:39`, `tooling/ci/money-property.mutation.mjs`

This is the most sophisticated guard in the repo: property tests over the money primitives, plus a mutation gate that plants six defects in `money.ts` and fails if the property suite does not kill every one. It is green, and two of its six mutants target `proRata` specifically.

It still cannot see F2, for two independent reasons:

1. **The weight generator cannot produce a zero weight.**
   ```ts
   const weights = () => fc.array(fc.bigInt({ min: 1n, max: 10n ** 24n }), …);   // min: 1n
   ```
   Zero weight is outside the search space, so no property can ever be evaluated on it.
2. **The two properties that constrain _allocation_ — "no share is off its exact entitlement by more than one unit" and "hands the leftover units to the largest remainders" — both use `positiveAmount()`.** Only the _conservation_ property uses `anyAmount()` (both signs), and conservation holds under F2.

So the defect sits exactly in the intersection of the generator's two blind spots. **The gate is not weak; its input domain is narrower than the function's.**

The suite's own comment shows this pattern has bitten once already: _"That mutant survived this suite until this test."_ F2 is the next one in the same series.

**Fix.** Allow `0n` in the weight generator, add the property _a zero weight receives exactly zero_, and extend the allocation properties to `anyAmount()`. Then add a seventh mutant that reverses the negative-total dust order, so the gate can prove it stays fixed.

---

### F4 · `pnpm verify` cannot pass in the main checkout, and it fails before any test runs

**Severity: MEDIUM (process, not product) · RAN-IT**
`tooling/ci/brand-scan.mjs` — `SKIP_DIRS`

`CLAUDE.md` non-negotiable #4 is _"Run `pnpm verify` before claiming done."_ In the operator's main checkout, that command exits 1:

```
✖ BRAND SCAN FAILED — 1519 occurrence(s) of a forbidden name (Doctrine §0.7)
✖ pnpm verify FAILED at: doctrine gates  (pnpm gates)
```

**Where the 1519 come from** — RAN-IT, grouped by top-level directory:

| Directory      | Hits | Tracked in git? |
| -------------- | ---: | --------------- |
| `.worktrees/`  | 1491 | no — gitignored |
| `docs/`        |   25 | yes             |
| `.pnpm-store/` |    2 | no — gitignored |
| `.tools/`      |    1 | no — gitignored |

**98.4 % of the failure is directories that are gitignored and therefore do not exist in CI.** `SKIP_DIRS` lists `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `.next`, `.turbo`, `coverage`, `drizzle`, `.docker-data` — but not these three. The same gate passes cleanly in a fresh worktree (verified: 27/27 green), which is why CI never sees it.

**Why it matters more than a noisy gate normally would:** `verify` **halts at the gates step**, so typecheck and the entire 48-package test suite never run. An agent that obeys the rule sees a red that has nothing to do with its work and learns nothing about whether its code is correct. The only paths forward are to ignore the command or route around it — and the header of `gates.mjs` says this file exists precisely to stop local and CI diverging.

**Second-order effect:** the 25 `docs/` hits are internal audit documents naming a model vendor or the upstream exchange. The gate has an `ALLOWLIST` with per-file reasons for exactly this class, but it is hand-maintained, so **every new internal document trips the gate until someone adds a line.** That is a permanent red, not an incident.

**Fix.** Add `.worktrees`, `.pnpm-store`, `.tools` to `SKIP_DIRS` (one line). Separately, decide whether `docs/` is shipped copy at all — if not, scope the gate to shipped surfaces instead of maintaining an allowlist that must grow forever.

### F5 · `tradeFill` can build a ledger post the ledger will always refuse

**Severity: MEDIUM (narrow input, but the documented recovery does not apply) · READ + RAN-IT**
`packages/ledger-client/src/recipes/index.ts:206` (`tradeFill`) and `:354` (`marketMakerMakerFill`) — the same defect, twice

```ts
const takerReceives = sub(makerPaysAmount, takerFee);
const makerReceives = sub(takerPaysAmount, makerFee);
if (takerReceives < 0n || makerReceives < 0n) {
  // <-- strictly less than
  throw new InvalidEntryError('Fee exceeds fill value — check fee bps configuration');
}
```

The guard catches a fee _larger_ than the receivable but not one _equal_ to it. When they are equal the recipe emits a **zero-amount entry**, and `assertBalanced` in `client.ts` throws:

> `Zero-amount entry on … — a movement of nothing is not a movement`

**Reachability.** `mulBps` rounds `ceil` by design, so any 1-wei receivable with a non-zero fee rate produces `fee == amount`. Fuzzing the recipe layer produced 2 329 such cases. Upstream, `settleFill` in `services/svc-trade/src/spot/trade-service.ts:822` guards `if (quoteAmount <= 0n)` and raises `trade.dust_fill` — it catches **zero**, not **one wei**.

**Why it is worse than a rejected post.** `settleFill` inserts the fill rows into `trade.fills` _before_ posting to the ledger. The README documents that ordering as deliberately safe: _"Worst case the funds stay in `hold`; re-running the fill re-posts the same idempotency key and heals it."_ For this failure class **re-running throws again, every time** — the fill is permanently unpostable and the fills table stays permanently ahead of the ledger. The documented recovery story does not cover it.

**The database permits exactly the configuration that triggers it.** `drizzle/0000_trade_init.sql:95` constrains the market grid to `CHECK ("tick_size" * "lot_size" >= 0.000000000000000001)` — the product may be **exactly one wei**. That constraint exists to stop a grid that yields a _zero_ quote amount, which is the same case `settleFill` guards and the same case `assertBalanced` rejects. **All three guards stop at zero and none of them covers one.** A market listed at the minimum legal grid is the trigger condition, not an exotic one.

It remains MEDIUM rather than HIGH because it needs that minimum-grid listing (or a fee rate above 50 %) to reach — no such market is known to be listed today.

**Fix.** Change both guards to `<= 0n` and raise the existing clear error, so the failure surfaces as _"fee exceeds fill value"_ at the recipe rather than as _"a movement of nothing"_ four layers down.

### F6 · Two of the twenty-seven gates inspect nothing and report "clean"

**Severity: MEDIUM (false green light) · RAN-IT + READ**
`tooling/ci/i18n-scan.mjs:47`, `tooling/ci/i18n-bypass-scan.mjs:80`

Both gates pass. Here is what they actually print:

```
✓ i18n-scan clean — 0 files, 0 hardcoded user-facing strings (§9, §14.4)
✓ i18n-bypass — 0 file(s), 0 hardcoded string(s), at the frozen baseline (0)
```

**Zero files.** The mechanism is a three-step collapse:

1. Both gates scan exactly one root: `const APPS = join(ROOT, 'apps')`.
2. `apps/` now contains exactly one project — `apps/admin` — because `apps/web` was deleted in **#757**.
3. Both gates allowlist `apps/admin` in full: _"operator console — internal tooling, English-only by design (§14.6)"_.

So the scope is empty, and **neither gate checks whether it scanned anything** — verified: no `scanned === 0` branch exists in either file. They take the `findings.length === 0` success path and exit 0.

`i18n-scan` does have a guard for an empty scope, but only for a _missing_ directory:

```js
if (!existsSync(APPS)) { console.log('✓ i18n-scan — no apps/ yet; the scan re-arms when the first surface lands (§9)'); … }
```

The author anticipated "nothing to scan" — but not the case where the directory exists and everything inside it is allowlisted. That is the state the repo is in now.

**This is not a one-off — it is this repo's recurring failure mode, now found three times.**

1. Commit `98a6812c`: _"fix(ci): the reachability gate inspected zero modules on Windows"_ — a gate green while inspecting nothing. **Fixed.**
2. `value-gate.mjs`, recorded in its own `NOT_GATES` entry: under `actions/checkout`'s default `fetch-depth: 1` it _"compared an empty ancestor list against an empty ancestor list and printed OK"_ — and that is named as **half of how PRs #832–#876 landed**. **Fixed** by pinning `fetch-depth: 0`.
3. **`i18n-scan` and `i18n-bypass-scan`, today.** Not yet fixed.

Three independent gates, three empty denominators, one of which is documented as having let a run of PRs through unchecked. The pattern is worth a standing rule, not another one-off fix: **a check that cannot state how many things it inspected cannot be trusted to say they were fine.**

**Calibration — what this is NOT.** It is not "i18n is unguarded and nobody noticed". The real i18n debt is known and honestly disclosed: `shell-i18n-scan.mjs` sits in `NOT_GATES` with the reason _"tip currently has 200+ hardcoded user-facing strings across the shell, so wiring it as blocking would red main… promote to GATES once the count is zero."_ That is exactly the honesty the `NOT_GATES` manifest was built to force, and it is working. The defect is narrower and purely about signal: **two entries in the "27 / 27 gates passed" headline are green because they looked at nothing**, and their wording reads as reassurance rather than as an empty scan.

**The full sweep — all 27 gates checked for an empty denominator.** RAN-IT. Every other gate reports a real, non-zero count of things inspected: reachability 390 modules · brand 1 219 files · secrets 2 030 source + 183 config files · vendor-shell 1 145 files · vendor-java-money 870 Java files · skip-honesty and test-db 274 test files · fabricated-money 95 shell files · migrations 48 · workspace 18 services · dual-book-door-paths 40 fragments. **Only `i18n` and `i18n-bypass` report zero.** Two gates of twenty-seven.

**The lesson already exists in this repo — it just was not generalised.** `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan` states in its own success line: _"16 module(s), 229 Java + 13 properties file(s) walked, **every denominator non-zero**"_ — that gate explicitly asserts it inspected something, and its mutation companion plants a "walk guard" defect to prove the assertion works. The correction is to apply that same discipline to the other 26.

**Fix.** One line in each i18n gate: exit non-zero (or print a loud `⚠ scanned 0 files — scope is empty`) when `scanned === 0`, matching what `98a6812c` did for reachability and what `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan` already does by design.

### F7 · Liquidating on the stored liq price silently discards a user's profit

**Severity: MEDIUM (latent — the column is never written today) · RAN-IT**
`services/svc-trade/src/futures/liquidation-planner.ts:92`

`planLiquidation` realizes **losses only**:

```ts
const loss = uPnL < 0n ? -uPnL : 0n;
const fromMargin = loss >= position.margin ? position.margin : loss;
const fromInsurance = loss > position.margin ? loss - position.margin : 0n;
const residualRelease = position.margin - fromMargin;
```

There is **no branch anywhere in this function that credits a positive PnL** — no `futuresRealizeProfit`, no gain leg. So if it can ever fire while a position is in profit, that profit is silently dropped.

**It can.** 2 148 of 40 000 fuzzed cases liquidated a position with `unrealizedPnl > 0`:

```
side=long  entry=80  mark=120  size=1  margin=10  liqPrice=120
  -> reason=mark_crossed_liq_price   uPnL=+40   loss=0   residualRelease=10   recipes=1
     the +40 gain is credited by NONE of those recipes
```

The user is up 40 USDT. They get their 10 USDT margin back and **nothing else**. No error, no refusal, no log — the plan is well-formed and the recipes balance.

**The equity path is correctly designed and is not the problem.** With `liqPrice` disabled entirely: **0 of 20 000** profit-liquidations. That is guaranteed by the arithmetic — `equity = margin + uPnL`, so `uPnL > 0` implies `equity > margin ≥ maintenance` for any `maintenanceBps ≤ 10 000`. The equity trigger _cannot_ fire in profit.

**The stored liq price is an independent trigger that bypasses the equity check entirely**, and the only validation applied to it is `> 0n`:

```ts
if (position.liqPrice != null && position.liqPrice > 0n) {
  const crossed = position.side === 'long' ? mark <= position.liqPrice : mark >= position.liqPrice;
  if (crossed) {
    should = true;
    reason = 'mark_crossed_liq_price';
  }
}
```

Nothing checks that a long's liq price is _below_ its entry, or a short's _above_. A stale value (after a margin top-up or a partial close), a wrong sign, or a short's price written onto a long all fire it.

**Why it is MEDIUM and not HIGH — verified, not assumed.** `liq_price` exists as a nullable column (`db/schema.ts:370`, migration `0003_trade_futures_positions.sql`) and is read by `position-loaders.ts`, but **no code in `services/svc-trade` ever writes it** — grepped for every `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`SET` touching `liq_price`: none. The column is always `NULL`, so the trigger never fires today. This is a loaded mechanism with no round in the chamber — and populating `liq_price` is the obvious next step for a futures product.

**Fix (two lines, both worth having).** Refuse the plan when `uPnL > 0n` and the only trigger was `mark_crossed_liq_price` — a profitable liquidation is a data bug and should surface as one, not as a silent transfer. And validate on load that a long's `liqPrice < entryPrice` and a short's `> entryPrice`.

**Adjacent observation (LOW, same files).** `initialMargin`, `notionalAt` and `unrealizedPnl` do their arithmetic with raw bigint `/` rather than the `mul`/`div` helpers in `money.ts`, so they inherit JavaScript's truncate-toward-zero instead of a stated rounding mode. `money.ts` opens with _"Rounding is always explicit. There is no default rounding mode, because 'whichever way the language rounds' is how a book drifts."_ The economic effect here is under one wei per operation and the truncation is sign-symmetric, so this is a doctrine deviation rather than a live loss — but it is in the futures money path, and it is the shape the doctrine names.

### F8 · Nothing in the repo measures code coverage, and one gate's name says otherwise

**Severity: MEDIUM · RAN-IT**
`tooling/ci/coverage-check.mjs`

> **RETRACTION — the first version of this finding was wrong, and the audit's own verification caught it.**
> It claimed `svc-bank`'s Earn and Transfers subsystems (1 035 lines, 11 ledger posts) had **no tests at all**, based on a grep for test files importing `earn-service.ts` / `transfer-service.ts` by filename. That grep was the error: both are exercised through the service facade in `bank-service.test.ts`, which imports `bank-service.ts`, which imports both — including `bank.transfers.transfer(...)` and an explicit idempotency case (_"a retried request moves value once"_). **Earn and Transfers are tested. The claim is withdrawn.**
> The supporting ratio was also misleading: `svc-bank` is **8 537 non-test source lines against 4 676 lines of tests and 238 test cases**, not "13 283 lines with 6 test files" — my line count included the test files themselves. An independent verifier re-measured it, sampled the test bodies, and found no `.only`, no `expect(true)`, no uncommitted snapshots, no assertion-free case, and arithmetic pinned to hand-computed literals. **`svc-bank`'s tests are good.** The premise that it was thinly tested was mine and it was wrong.

What survives, and it is independently confirmed by a fleet auditor on the same file:

**The repo has a green doctrine gate called `coverage` and no code-coverage enforcement anywhere.** Verified:

- There is **no vitest coverage configuration anywhere in the repo** — no thresholds, no v8/istanbul reporter, nothing.
- The doctrine gate **named `coverage` does not measure code coverage.** It maps law chapters to tracker rows (§25:740) — a genuinely valuable check, and it is well built. But `grep -icE "statement|line coverage|istanbul|v8 coverage|threshold"` over `tooling/ci/coverage-check.mjs` returns **0**.

So the repo has a green gate called "coverage" and **no code-coverage enforcement at all**. That is a naming trap: a reader scanning "27 / 27 gates passed" including one called `coverage` will reasonably conclude that test coverage is gated. It is not. `coverage-check` is a genuinely valuable gate — it is simply not the thing its name suggests.

**The real, verified coverage gap it leaves unseen** is narrower than my retracted claim and sits one layer down: **`svc-bank`'s only production path to the ledger has no test.** `services/svc-bank/src/ledger-client.ts` is the HTTP transport every real transfer, earn deposit, interest accrual, loan draw and liquidation goes through in production, and all 238 `svc-bank` cases substitute `MemoryLedger` instead — `grep -rn "ledger-client.js'" --include='*.test.ts' services/svc-bank/src` returns nothing. A verifier confirmed the fact and then corrected the framing around it: **`svc-bank` is not the outlier.** `svc-bank`, `svc-agents`, `svc-trade` and `svc-token` all lack a wire test; `svc-p2p`'s covers only error rehydration. **`svc-pay` is the only service in the repo with a real one** (370 lines asserting amounts serialise as decimal strings, that no JSON number appears in the payload, and that 18 decimals survive the trip).

**Fix.** Copy `svc-pay`'s `ledger-client.test.ts` pattern to the other five services — it is the one test that proves money survives the wire, and five services move money without it. Separately, decide whether a code-coverage floor is wanted at all; if it is, put it on the money packages only, because a repo-wide percentage is the kind of number teams learn to game.

Two candidate findings were **killed by the lead during verification** and are recorded so they are not re-raised: an apparent double-entry break in `mintEmission` (an artifact of the harness passing a string where an `AccountRef` was required), and the engine accepting an out-of-vocabulary `tif` (real, but ingress validates against a zod enum at `services/svc-matching/src/router.ts:195`, so it is defence-in-depth only — logged as LOW).

These are **not findings** — the repo already knows about each one and has recorded it honestly. They are listed because they sit in the Class X lane (owner actions), which is the operator's to move, and because a reader skimming "27 / 27 gates passed" would not otherwise see them.

**Methodology note, verified not assumed:** the fleet's shell working directory defaults to the main checkout, which is the stale tree. This was checked rather than trusted — the `svc-bank` auditor's own `find` returned **28** TypeScript files, and 28 is the tip's count (the stale tree has 22). The auditors are reading the correct tree.

---

## 4 · Fleet results — 84 auditors, adversarially verified

Eighty-four parallel auditors ran against tip `6a4a360a`, producing **475 raw findings**. Each was then sent to independent verifiers whose brief was to **kill it**.

**The honest count, because it matters more than the headline:**

|                                                          |   Count |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------: |
| Raw findings produced                                    |     475 |
| **Confirmed by adversarial verification**                |  **59** |
| Genuinely refuted by a verifier                          |      11 |
| **Verifier never ran** (agent died on the session limit) | **405** |

The 405 are _not_ refuted and must not be read as such — the workflow's own arithmetic counted a dead verifier the same as a refutation, which would have overstated confidence enormously. **A second verification pass was run over all 405 and completed with zero errors** (§5): 304 confirmed, 100 refuted, 1 unjudged.

**Final position across both passes:**

|                                           |   Count |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------: |
| Raw findings                              |     475 |
| **Confirmed by adversarial verification** | **363** |
| Refuted on inspection                     |     111 |
| Unjudged                                  |       1 |

Confirmed severity, combined: **1 critical · 39 high · 164 medium · 158 low.** Every one was read against the real source by a verifier briefed to kill it; roughly **one claim in four did not survive**.

Of the 59 confirmed, verifiers **downgraded 4 of 4 reported criticals** to high or medium, and downgraded 14 findings overall. That is the verification working: severity inflation is the most common failure in this kind of sweep, and it was caught rather than passed on.

### 4.1 · The headline: the safety apparatus is the largest cluster of confirmed defects

**33 of the 59 confirmed findings are in `tooling/ci/` — the 27 gates that certify everything else.** Only 25 are in the product. The thing most likely to be wrong in this repo is the machine that says nothing is wrong.

Six that matter most, each a gate that is green and does not do what its name says:

**`secret-scan` is blind to the hot-wallet key.** — _lead-verified_ Its credential-name pattern requires the credential word to _end_ the name, and neither a bare `_KEY` suffix nor `MNEMONIC` is in its vocabulary. Tested against the real regex with controls, so a pass and a fail both appear:

```
  MISSED  PAY_CRYPTO_HOT_WALLET_KEY     signs every payout
  MISSED  PAY_CRYPTO_DEPOSIT_MNEMONIC   derives every deposit address
  MISSED  WALLET_SIGNING_KEY
  MISSED  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY_LIVE
  MISSED  JWT_SIGNING_KEY
  CAUGHT  DATABASE_PASSWORD             (control)
  CAUGHT  INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET       (control)
  CAUGHT  API_TOKEN                     (control)
```

Both wallet names are real and in production use (`services/svc-pay/src/env.ts:103,105`; `rails/posture.ts:515-516`). Commit either into a tracked `.env` or a compose block and **`secret-scan` prints "clean"**. For a platform holding crypto, this is the most dangerous confirmed finding in the audit. `compose-secret-parity` shares the same regex shape and the same blind spot.

**`dual-book-door-scan` is satisfied by an unused import.** — _lead-verified_ The dual-book door is the boundary between the vendored exchange's own wallet tables and the sovereign ledger — architecturally the most important guard in the system. The gate's entire registration test is `text.includes('DualBookMoneyDoorInterceptor')` over the whole file (`:75`), and the config also carries `import …DualBookMoneyDoorInterceptor;` at line 16.

Proved by taking the door off its hinges in memory and re-running the check:

```
registration line still present after gutting?               false
gate check  text.includes("DualBookMoneyDoorInterceptor") -> true
what still satisfies it: ['import com.bizzan.bitrade.interceptor.DualBookMoneyDoorInterceptor;']
```

Delete the real `registry.addInterceptor(new DualBookMoneyDoorInterceptor()).addPathPatterns("/**")` line, leave the import Java happily compiles unused, and the gate still prints _"✓ interceptor + registration on admin, ucenter-api, otc-api, exchange-api."_

**`custody-scan` would pass a real ledger write out of `svc-dex`.** It matches `ledger.post(` only when the receiver is literally spelled `ledger` (`client.post(` is invisible), and its recipe list hardcodes 18 names when the package exports 48. Its Solidity check is worse: every withdrawal-power pattern requires an `onlyOwner`/`onlyAdmin` modifier, and **this repo's contracts contain zero `only*` modifiers** — they guard with `if (…) revert`. That check has never had a true positive available to it.

**`vendor-java-money-scan` only inspects four method names.** — _lead-verified_ Its own header claims it "closes re-arming by any phrasing at all." It does not. `WALLET_MUTATORS` at line 152 is exactly `['increaseBalance','decreaseBalance','freezeBalance','thawBalance']`, and line 613 reads `if (!mutator) continue;` — **the check is skipped entirely** for any DAO method not named one of those four. A fifth method with any other name writing `UPDATE member_wallet SET balance = …` sails through, which is the exact case the header says it closed.

**`event-wiring` proves the file is imported, not that the handler is ever called.** A `bus.subscribe(...)` inside an exported function that nothing invokes counts as "wired end to end" as soon as any reached file imports its module.

**`migration-check` prints "all 48 migrations reversible" from filename pairing alone.** — _lead-verified_ Reversibility is decided at line 41 by `up.replace(/\.sql$/, '.down.sql')` existing in a filename set. It reads the _up_ file only (line 51) and **never opens a single `.down.sql`** — so an empty file, or one containing a comment, satisfies "reversible". Its destructive list is exactly `[DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN, TRUNCATE, DROP SCHEMA]`: **`DELETE FROM` is not in it**, nor is constraint removal. A migration that deletes rows from the ledger is not destructive as far as this gate is concerned.

**`brand-scan`** — independently confirms F4 above, with the same mechanism and a re-measured count (the number drifts with the number of worktrees; it must not be quoted as fixed).

### 4.2 · The most serious finding in the audit: a retried loan drains the lending reserve

**Severity: CRITICAL · confirmed by an independent verifier and then re-verified personally by the lead**
`services/svc-bank/src/loans/loan-service.ts:468-478, 490-499, 515`

**In plain terms:** a borrower asks for a huge loan against collateral they do not have. That attempt fails — but it leaves the huge loan amount saved. They then retry with the same loan id and a tiny amount of collateral. The safety check looks at the _tiny_ new request and passes it. The payout uses the _huge_ saved one. They put up dust and walk away with the original amount.

The mechanism, verified line by line:

1. **The loan-to-value check reads the new request.** Lines 468-478 compute `openingLtv` from `input.principal` and `input.collateralAmount` and refuse if it exceeds the product's limit.
2. **The row is written before the money moves, and a retry silently reuses it.** Line 490 inserts with a **caller-supplied** `loanId` under `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING`. On a retry nothing is inserted, so line 501 re-reads and `loan` becomes the **first call's** row — carrying the **first call's principal**.
3. **The payout draws from the old row while the collateral lock uses the new input.** Line 515 is `return this.completePending(loan, input.collateralAmount, openingLtv, now)` — the _old_ `loan` and the _new_ collateral, in the same call. `completePending` then locks `input.collateralAmount` and draws `loan.principal` (line 546).
4. **Nothing reconciles the two.** There is no check anywhere that a pending row's principal matches the principal of the request retrying it.

Attack, concretely: open loan `X` for 1 000 000 against 2 000 000 of collateral you do not hold — LTV passes, the row persists at 1 000 000, the collateral lock fails for insufficient funds, the loan stays `pending`. Retry loan `X` for 1 against 2 of collateral you _do_ hold — LTV passes on the new numbers, the insert conflicts and does nothing, and the service locks 2 units of collateral and **draws 1 000 000**. Repeat until the reserve is empty.

**Fix.** On the retry path, refuse when the persisted row's `principal` differs from `input.principal` — or re-derive LTV from `loan.principal` rather than `input.principal`, so the check and the payout can never read different numbers.

---

### 4.3 · The two most serious confirmed findings in trading

**No maximum leverage is enforced on the futures open path.** Verified personally: the only constraints anywhere are `leverage > 0` in `initial-margin.ts:12` and `CHECK ("leverage" > 0)` in the migration. `public-rest.ts:190` literally advertises `leverage: { min: null, max: null }`. The doctrine's 10× cap is unimplemented. _(Correction to the reported version: the column is `numeric(8,2)`, so leverage caps at 999 999.99 rather than being unbounded — functionally the same hole.)_ A user can lock 10 USDT and control millions in notional, and a favourable move is paid out of the house fee pot.

**Funding payments drain a position's collateral while `margin_initial` is never reduced.** Verified personally, all three legs:

- `futuresFundingPay` **credits** `positionCollateralAccount(payer, asset, positionId)` — that is value leaving the position's own collateral pot.
- `margin_initial` has **no `UPDATE` anywhere in the repo** — it is inserted at open and only ever read back.
- `funding_paid` has **no writer either** — it is inserted as `'0'` at open (`position-service.ts:372`) and read only for display.

Both the close planner and the liquidation planner compute the amount to release from `margin_initial`. So after any funding period the pot holds less than `margin_initial` says, and **every subsequent close releases more than is there** and overdraws. This is a live money-loss path, not a latent one — it needs only that funding runs once before a close.

## 5 · Second verification pass — the 405 findings whose verifiers died

The first run's verifiers were killed mid-flight by a session limit, and the workflow's arithmetic counted a dead verifier identically to a refutation. Reporting those 405 as "refuted" would have been the single biggest false-confidence error this audit could make, so a second pass was run over all of them — one verifier per file, reading the real source, briefed to kill.

|                                        |   Count |
| -------------------------------------- | ------: |
| Findings re-submitted for verification |     405 |
| Judged in this pass                    | **404** |
| **Confirmed**                          | **304** |
| Refuted on inspection                  |     100 |
| Still unjudged                         |       1 |

Confirmed by verified severity: **1 critical · 28 high · 141 medium · 134 low**. The refutation rate of 25% is the verification doing its job — roughly one claim in four did not survive contact with the source.

### 5.1 · Confirmed critical and high

Each carries a plain-English line written for a non-technical reader.

**`services/svc-bank/src/loans/loan-service.ts:463`** — _critical_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
A retried loans.open re-validates LTV against the NEW request's principal but draws the OLD persisted principal — a borrower can draw unbounded principal against dust col

> **In plain terms:** If someone tries to open a loan pledging more collateral than they own, the failed attempt leaves the big loan amount saved; retrying with a tiny amount of collateral pays out the original big amount, letting a borrower drain the lending pot.

**`docker-compose.yml:62`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
NATS is published on every interface with no authentication, and a forged `orderFilled` on it settles a real fill through the ledger

> **In plain terms:** The internal message bus that services use to tell each other a trade filled has no password and is open to the whole network, so anyone on the same network as a machine running the platform can send a fake fill message that the system books as real money movement.

**`packages/events/src/bus.ts:260`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
idempotent() marks the dedupe key BEFORE running the handler, so a handler that throws once is never retried and its redelivery is acked — the event is permanently lost

> **In plain terms:** If a service hiccups while handling an event, that event is marked done before it was actually handled — so the retry is silently thrown away instead of being retried or flagged for a human.

**`packages/events/src/jetstream-bus.ts:99`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
Consumers nak with zero backoff against max_deliver 5, and the dead-letter subject the API promises does not exist anywhere in the repo — a few seconds of downstream fail

> **In plain terms:** When a downstream step fails for even a second, the system retries five times instantly, gives up, and throws the event away with no alert and no holding area — despite the code promising one.

**`services/svc-academy/src/stake-source.ts:58`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
Staked-lobby gate is inflated by 10^18: svc-token serialises the stake as a raw scaled bigint, svc-academy re-scales it, so any non-zero staker clears every threshold

> **In plain terms:** The paid-lobby entry check reads the staked amount a million-million-times too large, so anyone holding even a trace of the token gets into every stake-gated room for free.

**`services/svc-bank/src/earn/earn-service.ts:461`** — _high_ (reported high, confidence high)  
Earn accrual pays a full day's interest to positions opened the same day, so a deposit made minutes before the daily cron earns a whole day and can be withdrawn immediate

> **In plain terms:** Someone can park a large deposit in a savings pool for one minute right before the nightly interest run, collect a whole day's interest, and pull the money straight back out — repeatable every night, draining the pot that pays your honest savers.

**`services/svc-edge/src/control-plane.ts:43`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
The operator kill-switch is bypassable with a `../` in the path: the guard and the proxy parse the URL differently

> **In plain terms:** If you switch a market off during an incident, someone can still get new orders through by writing the web address in a slightly different but equivalent form — the off-switch checks the address before it is tidied up, and the forwarder checks it after, so they disagree; the console will keep telling you the market is halted while orders are being accepted.

**`services/svc-identity/src/router.ts:203`** — _high_ (reported high, confidence high)  
A stolen access token can enrol its own TOTP factor and then step up to trade:withdraw, defeating the one control that exists to stop exactly that

> **In plain terms:** If someone steals a logged-in user's session, they can set up their own two-factor code on that account and use it to authorise a withdrawal, so the two-factor withdrawal check protects nobody who had not already turned two-factor on.

**`services/svc-matching/src/engine/engine.ts:271`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
A match is applied to the book before its events publish; if a publish fails the SubmitResult is thrown away and nothing ever republishes the fill

> **In plain terms:** If the message broker hiccups at the wrong moment, a trade the engine has already matched can be silently voided — nobody loses money, but the trade never settles and the two systems disagree until someone reconciles by hand.

**`services/svc-matching/src/engine/engine.ts:270`** — _high_ (reported high, confidence high)  
A match is applied to the book before its events are published, with no outbox, no retry and no re-emit on recovery — a NATS failure or a crash after the match loses the

> **In plain terms:** A trade is committed inside the engine before anyone else is told about it, and if that message fails there is no automatic retry — the trade is lost and only a manual reconciliation will find it.

**`services/svc-p2p/src/p2p-service.ts:1943`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
Reputation upsert is a read-modify-write with no lock when the row is absent, so two concurrent first-ever trades lose a counter and then permanently block the trade's te

> **In plain terms:** If the very first two P2P trades of the same person start at the exact same moment, a hidden counter goes one short, and later one of that person's trades can get permanently stuck with the crypto locked in escrow until someone fixes it by hand.

**`services/svc-pay/src/ledger-client.ts:36`** — _high_ (reported high, confidence high)  
svc-pay is the only ledger client still signing v1 (no body binding), so its captured signature is a replayable money instruction and svc-ledger can never be flipped to `

> **In plain terms:** The payments service is the last one still sending money instructions to the ledger without proof of what it asked for — anyone who can watch internal traffic could reuse a captured request within five minutes to make the ledger do something else entirely, and it is also the single thing blocking the security setting that would close this for good.

**`services/svc-pay/src/payment-service.ts:1938`** — _high_ (reported high, confidence high)  
payoutSettlement reverses the merchant's hold with no durable marker — a crash before the attempt counter advances leaves the retry settling out of a hold that was alread

> **In plain terms:** If the payout system is killed at one precise instant after a failed payout, a later retry can send the money out for real while the merchant still holds it in their balance.

refund posts to the ledger inside the database transaction — a commit failure orphans a merchant debit under a refundId that a later, different-sized refund silently reus

**`services/svc-pay/src/payment-service.ts:904`** — _high_ (reported high, confidence high)  
getMerchant runs on the shared pool from inside an open transaction — ten concurrent public checkout opens deadlock every database connection in svc-pay

> **In plain terms:** Ten shoppers opening a checkout page at the same instant can freeze the whole payments service until someone restarts it, and anyone with the public link can trigger it.

**`services/svc-pay/src/payment-service.ts:1694`** — _high_ (reported medium, confidence medium)  
A refund landing between the settlement freeze and the settlement post silently over-credits the merchant, because the frozen gross is never recomputed and the clearing a

A refund landing between the settlement freeze and the settlement post makes the merchant settle a gross that no longer exists

A crash between eth_sendRawTransaction and the broadcast journal leaves a permanent **pending** row; the withdrawal retry path then rotates the idempotency key and broadc

> **In plain terms:** If the payments service crashes at the wrong instant while sending a customer withdrawal, the money can go out twice while the customer is refunded once, so the company silently loses the full withdrawal amount.

**`services/svc-token/src/index.ts:84`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
The S2S stake endpoint returns the raw scaled bigint instead of a decimal string, so svc-academy re-scales it by 10^18 and every staked-lobby gate opens for a dust stake

> **In plain terms:** The staking service reports a user's stake in the wrong units to the Academy service, so anyone holding a fraction of a coin passes the 'staked lobby' entry check as if they held a thousand — the paywall for staked rooms is effectively open.

**`services/svc-trade/src/events.ts:38`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
The matching-event recovery path is at-most-once: a failed fill settlement or hold release is marked seen before it runs and is never retried

> **In plain terms:** The backup path that is supposed to re-settle a trade when the main path dies gives up after a single failed attempt, so a trade can end up recorded but never actually paid, with the customer's funds left locked.

**`services/svc-trade/src/events.ts:42`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
The matching-event recovery consumers mark an event as processed BEFORE running the handler, so any fill or cancel whose settlement throws is acked and never retried

> **In plain terms:** Duplicate of the previous item: one trade can be marked as done in the trading records while the money never moves, because the retry is silently skipped.

**`services/svc-trade/src/spot/trade-service.ts:585`** — _high_ (reported high, confidence medium)  
placeOrder submits to the matching engine without checking that the pending->open update applied, so a concurrent cancel can leave an unfunded order live in the book

> **In plain terms:** If a customer cancels at the same instant their order is being funded, the order can end up live on the exchange with the money already given back, and any trade against it cannot be paid out.

**`services/svc-trade/src/spot/trade-service.ts:1295`** — _high_ (reported high, confidence medium)  
A cancel racing an in-flight fill releases the whole hold, because finalize reads trade.fills under a lock that settleFill never takes

> **In plain terms:** A customer who cancels at the same moment their order is being filled can get their whole reservation back while the trade has already happened, leaving the other side's money stuck and the trade unpaid.

**`services/svc-trade/src/spot/trade-service.ts:1302`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence medium)  
cancelOrder releases a hold that a printed-but-not-yet-recorded fill is about to spend, permanently unsettling the trade

> **In plain terms:** Same issue as the cancel-versus-fill race above: no money is invented, but a trade can print on the exchange and never get paid, with the other side's funds left locked.

**`services/svc-ws/src/private/gateway.ts:117`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
Private WS gateway leaves the socket with no 'error' listener when the hub is at capacity — one malformed frame kills the whole svc-ws process

> **In plain terms:** A logged-in user who first opens enough connections to fill the live-updates service can then crash the whole service with a single bad message, taking price and trade streams down with it until it restarts.

**`tooling/scripts/swarm.mjs:367`** — _high_ (reported high, confidence high)  
An unrecognised claim-lock status silently means "no lock" — TRK-agents.scanner is on the free board RIGHT NOW while a live worktree is building it

> **In plain terms:** The swarm's job-claim files only count if they use one of a few exact words; two claims written with the word 'open' are being ignored, so that work is showing as unclaimed and can be handed to a second agent.

**`vendor/upstream-exchange/05_Web_Front/src/App.vue:564`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
The sign-out button on the sole deployed product surface does not sign the user out

> **In plain terms:** On the live trading site, clicking Log Out does not log you out — the account stays signed in on that machine until the browser tab is closed; the team already has this written down as an outstanding fix.

**`vendor/upstream-exchange/05_Web_Front/src/App.vue:565`** — _high_ (reported critical, confidence high)  
"Log out" does not log you out — it calls a retired backend and never clears the session

> **In plain terms:** The Log Out button on the live site is wired to a shut-down old system, so the user stays signed in with the site still showing their name — a risk on any shared or borrowed computer.

**`vendor/upstream-exchange/05_Web_Front/src/pages/exchange/Exchange.vue:1871`** — _high_ (reported high, confidence high)  
The desk's percent-size buttons build order quantities from a decimal-place COUNT, so every percent-sized order on the six FX pairs and NATGAS is rejected by the engine

> **In plain terms:** On the six currency pairs and natural gas, the 25/50/75/100% quick-size buttons on the trading screen produce an order size the exchange will always refuse, so those buttons are effectively broken.

## 6 · What to fix, in order

Ranked by _damage if left_ ÷ _effort to fix_. Every one of these is confirmed — either by the lead agent running code, or by an independent verifier reading the source. Nothing speculative is in this list.

### Tier 0 — the launch blocker

| #   | Fix                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Where                                             | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 0   | On the loan retry path, refuse when the persisted row's `principal` differs from `input.principal` — or re-derive LTV from `loan.principal` so the safety check and the payout can never read different numbers | `services/svc-bank/src/loans/loan-service.ts:515` | The one confirmed **critical**. Not exploitable today only because no loan product row exists. **This must be closed before lending is switched on** — after that it is an unbounded drain of the lending reserve |

### Tier 1 — small fixes that close real money or credential holes

| #   | Fix                                                                                                                                              | Where                                                                        | Why it is first                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Add `key`, `mnemonic`, `seed` to the credential-name pattern, and allow a trailing qualifier so `SECRET_KEY_LIVE` matches                        | `tooling/ci/secret-scan.mjs` + the same shape in `compose-secret-parity.mjs` | Today the hot-wallet signing key and the deposit mnemonic can be committed and the gate prints "clean". Roughly a one-line change to a regex |
| 2   | Enforce a maximum leverage in `PositionService.open()` before `initialMargin` runs                                                               | `services/svc-trade/src/futures/`                                            | The doctrine's 10× cap is simply not implemented; the API advertises no maximum                                                              |
| 3   | Make funding move the position row with the money — reduce `margin_initial` (or add `margin_current` the planners read) and write `funding_paid` | `services/svc-trade/src/futures/`                                            | Every close after a funding period over-releases collateral. Live, not latent                                                                |
| 4   | Match the actual `registry.addInterceptor(...).addPathPatterns("/**")` call, not the class name                                                  | `tooling/ci/dual-book-door-scan.mjs`                                         | The architectural boundary between the vendored exchange and the sovereign ledger is currently proved by an unused `import` line             |
| 5   | Add `.worktrees`, `.pnpm-store`, `.tools` to `SKIP_DIRS` — better, derive the skip set from `.gitignore`                                         | `tooling/ci/brand-scan.mjs`                                                  | Restores `pnpm verify` in the main checkout. Today it dies at step 1 and the test suite never runs                                           |
| 6   | Change the two zero-length guards to fail loudly: `if (scanned === 0)`                                                                           | `tooling/ci/i18n-scan.mjs`, `i18n-bypass-scan.mjs`                           | Two of the 27 gates currently certify nothing. `brand-scan` already has exactly this guard — copy it                                         |

### Tier 1b — the other confirmed highs, grouped by the shape of the fix

These came out of the second verification pass and each was read against the source by an independent checker. Grouped because several share one root cause.

| Group                     | Fix                                                                                                                                                                              | Where                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Perimeter**             | Make the kill-switch guard normalise the path before deciding, so a request cannot reach the API by a route the guard does not recognise                                         | `services/svc-edge/src/control-plane.ts:43`                                          |
| **Perimeter**             | Put authentication on the message bus and stop publishing it on every interface — an unauthenticated bus lets a forged "trade filled" settle through the ledger                  | `docker-compose.yml:62`                                                              |
| **Perimeter**             | Stop a session from enrolling its own second factor and then using it to clear the withdrawal step-up                                                                            | `services/svc-identity/src/router.ts:203`                                            |
| **At-most-once delivery** | Mark the dedupe key _after_ the handler succeeds, not before — currently anything that fails once is never retried. Same bug in three places                                     | `packages/events/src/bus.ts:260`, `services/svc-trade/src/events.ts:38,42`           |
| **At-most-once delivery** | Give the matching engine an outbox, or re-emit on recovery — a match is applied to the book before its event publishes, and a publish failure loses the fill with no repair path | `services/svc-matching/src/engine/engine.ts:270`                                     |
| **Order/hold races**      | Read the row count on the pending→open update before submitting to the engine; and make the cancel path and the fill path take the same lock                                     | `services/svc-trade/src/spot/trade-service.ts:585, 1295, 1302`                       |
| **Payments durability**   | Move the ledger post out of the database transaction, and give the settlement reversal a durable marker so a crash cannot strand it                                              | `services/svc-pay/src/payment-service.ts:1426, 1938`, `rails/broadcast-store.ts:138` |
| **Payments auth**         | Move `svc-pay` onto the body-bound signing scheme the other five services already use — its captured signature is replayable today                                               | `services/svc-pay/src/ledger-client.ts:36`                                           |
| **Scaling bug**           | `svc-token` returns a raw scaled integer where a decimal string is expected, and `svc-academy` scales it again — the staked-lobby gate is inflated by 10¹⁸                       | `services/svc-token/src/index.ts:84`, `svc-academy/src/stake-source.ts:58`           |

### Tier 2 — guards that need real logic, not a regex tweak

| #   | Fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Where                                                         |

### Tier 3 — latent, but cheap to close while the context is fresh

| #   | Fix                                                                                                                                                                           | Where                                                   |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 13  | Refuse a negative total in `proRata`, or skip zero-weight entries in the dust loop                                                                                            | `packages/ledger-client/src/money.ts`                   |
| 14  | Widen the money property suite: allow `0n` weights, extend the allocation properties to negative totals, and assert _a zero weight receives exactly zero_                     | `packages/ledger-client/src/money.property.test.ts`     |
| 15  | Change the fill guards from `< 0n` to `<= 0n` in both `tradeFill` and `marketMakerMakerFill`                                                                                  | `packages/ledger-client/src/recipes/index.ts`           |

| 17  | Delete or finish the two orphaned uncommitted files in the main checkout (`svc-academy/src/certs/`, `svc-notify/src/required-channels.ts`) — the first breaks typecheck there | main checkout only                                      |

### The standing rule this audit would propose

Three separate gates in this repo have now been caught **reporting green while inspecting nothing** — the reachability gate on Windows (fixed), the value gate under `fetch-depth: 1` (fixed, and named as _half of how PRs #832–#876 landed_), and the two i18n gates (live today). One gate, `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan`, already defends against this explicitly: its success line asserts _"every denominator non-zero."_

**Make that the rule for all 27: a gate that cannot state how many things it inspected is not allowed to say they were fine.**
