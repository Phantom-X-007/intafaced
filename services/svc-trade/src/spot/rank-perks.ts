/**
 * RANK PERKS (§4.1, §5.2 "fee-tier").
 *
 * svc-identity owns the ladder; this service reads one field from it. The
 * contract shape lives in `packages/contracts`, so a change to the perk table
 * is a compile error here rather than a silently ignored field.
 *
 * WHEN this is read matters more than how. It is read ONCE, at order placement,
 * and the result is snapshotted onto the order row. Two consequences, both
 * deliberate:
 *
 *   1. A rank change cannot retroactively re-price an order that was already
 *      accepted on the old terms — the same reason `token.stakes` snapshots its
 *      multiplier at open.
 *   2. The fill path makes no network call. A fill must settle even when
 *      svc-identity is down, because by then the match has already printed and
 *      the counterparty is already owed.
