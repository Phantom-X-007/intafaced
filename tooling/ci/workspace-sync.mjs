/**
 * WORKSPACE SYNC — every workspace package reaches the image and the fleet.
 *
 * Three times in one day a service was added and a deployment file was not:
 *
 *   1. five mounted services never received EDGE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET in compose,
 *      so each would crash-loop on a boot secret that has no default;
 *   2. svc-edge — the front door — had no compose block at all, so the fleet
 *      came up behind a door that was never opened;
 *   3. four services were missing from the Dockerfile's manifest list.
 *
 * None of those failed loudly at the point of the mistake. The Dockerfile one
 * is the nastiest: pnpm installs a workspace whose manifest it cannot see as
 * though it had no dependencies, so the error arrives much later as
 * "Cannot find module '@intafaced/contracts'" during a build — which reads like
 * a broken import, not a missing COPY.
 *
 * This makes all three loud, at the commit that causes them.
 *
 * ── The shape every rule here shares ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each check exists because something came up GREEN while being wrong. That is
 * the only class this file is for. A container that crashes is already loud; a
 * container that is healthy, passes its health check, and answers 404 or
 * ECONNREFUSED on everything else is not, and it has cost this repo several
 * sessions each time. Checks 5 and 6 came from exactly that, and 7–10 below
 * cover the variants they still let through — a database role that was never
 * created, a schema no runner migrates, a hostname that does not resolve, and a
 * dev fallback pointing at a live service that answers a different API.
 *
 * If you add a rule, say WHY in the code. A gate whose reasoning is elsewhere
 * gets deleted by the next person who hits it at an inconvenient moment.
 *
 * Exit 0 = the workspace, the image and the fleet agree.

 *
 * `apps/` and `packages/` are OUR layout and are exactly one level deep, so

 * upstream chose, and pinning a depth is how the next one escapes. So this
 * walks until it finds manifests rather than assuming where they are.
 *
 * Directories are NOT named here — discovered. Spelling the vendored path in
 * this file would put the upstream vendor's identity in our own source and trip

 * also the better rule regardless: a second vendored tree is covered the moment
 * it lands, with no edit here.
 *

// ── 7 · a user-facing app that cannot be run ────────────────────────────────
//
// The failure this exists for, in full, because it cost four days:
//
// The vendored trading shell is the stated product — 74 screens, and the
// direction has always been that our features go on top of it. It had no
// `dist`, no Dockerfile and no compose entry. The only way to see it was
// `npm run dev` by hand. Documents sent readers to `:8090`; nothing ever served
// that port.
//
// So one developer put 48 commits into it WITHOUT EVER SEEING IT RENDER, while
// a different app — added two days before the shell was vendored — stayed on
// :3000 as the de-facto product purely because it was the only one that
// started. Nobody chose that. It is what happens when the intended thing cannot
// be run and the unintended thing can.
//
// No gate caught it, because every gate here asked "does this service reach the
// fleet?" and a front-end is not a service.
//
// So: a directory with a build script is a thing somebody expects to be able to
// look at, and it either appears in compose or carries a written `# no-deploy:`
// reason. Silence is the thing being forbidden.
//
// The trigger is the build script ALONE — deliberately, and not because a
// tighter test was unavailable. Requiring an `index.html` or a Next config too
// would read as more precise and would fail in the direction that has no
// remedy: a front-end this gate does not recognise is silent again, which is
// the entire bug. A false positive costs one `# no-deploy:` line with a reason,
// which is a sentence someone should have written anyway.

  // otherwise satisfy it. That is the quiet direction of the same bug: a gate
  // reporting deployed because someone wrote a paragraph about the thing they
  // did not deploy. The `no-deploy` block below this one is exactly such a
  // paragraph.
  //
  // "Was a reason written?" is answered against the RAW text, because a written
  // reason IS a comment. Blank comments for both and the escape hatch stops
  // working; keep them for both and the escape hatch is accidental.
