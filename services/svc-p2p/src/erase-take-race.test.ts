/**
 * THE ERASE/TAKE RACE — a person told their bank details were gone, while a
 * trade was being written that still holds them in cleartext.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT WAS REPRODUCED
 *
 * `eraseFor` ran at READ COMMITTED and took no lock. Its refusal read took no
 * `FOR UPDATE`, and nothing re-examined it before commit. A take that read the
 * instrument row after erase's UPDATEs and before its COMMIT saw the pre-update
 * version — which is not a bug in MVCC, it is MVCC — and froze the account
 * number onto a brand new trade:
 *
 *     erase · refusal check      -> 0 live trades (proceeds)
 *     erase · REPORTS TO USER:      instruments erased=1, frozen snapshots erased=1
 *     take  · attachToTrade         sees 1 active instrument(s)
 *     trade snapshot: { "purged_at": null, "details": { "account_reference": "…" } }
 *
 * And it does not heal: `purgeExpiredSnapshots` only sweeps TERMINATED trades,
 * so a trade that never terminates carries the details for as long as it exists.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * HOW THE INTERLEAVE IS MADE DETERMINISTIC
 *
 * A concurrency test that "usually" hits the window proves nothing on the run
 * where it does not, so nothing here is timing-dependent in the sense that
 * matters. A third connection holds a `FOR UPDATE` row lock on the ONE
 * `trade_payment_instruments` row that already exists — the snapshot on an
 * earlier, settled trade. `eraseFor` updates `payment_instruments` and then
 * that table, in that order, so the lock parks erase at exactly the point the
 * report is about to become untrue: after the instrument is `removed` in its
 * transaction, before anything is committed.
 *
 * The take is then run against that window. Which of the two wins is not the
 * property under test; the property is that the loser SEES the winner.
 *
 * The offer is deliberately one that has already been traded, so erase's
 * `DELETE FROM p2p.offers … NOT EXISTS (…)` matches no row and takes no lock on
 * it. Otherwise erase and the take would contend on the offer instead, and the
 * test would be measuring the wrong lock.
 *
 * H8a PG-hard: this file never `describe.skip` / `postgresAvailable`. CI uses
 * TEST_DATABASE_URL (per-run database via `createTestDatabase` so schema-qualified
 * `p2p.*` SQL stays on `p2p`). Local without that env starts Testcontainers
 * `postgres:16-alpine`. Docker/PG down is a failed suite, not a green skip.
