/**
 * DEPENDENCY AUDIT — the ratchet.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Phase B §5 kills "Hot-wallet random npm — custody supply chain". We wrote the
 * ban and then installed nothing that checks it. At the commit that added this
 * file the tree carried 12 distinct advisories, 8 of them high, and nobody knew
 * — because there was no dependabot config, no renovate config, no `pnpm audit`
 * anywhere in CI, and no SBOM. A mutation-tested secret scanner sat beside a
 * dependency tree nothing had ever looked at.
 *
 * WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A BLOCKING SEVERITY GATE
 *
 * `pnpm audit --audit-level=high` on day one exits non-zero, so wiring that as
 * required would red main immediately and the gate would be deleted within the
 * day. That is the same trap `shell-i18n-scan.mjs` documents for its 200+
 * hardcoded strings, and it is why that one is deliberately NOT a gate.
 *
 * So this uses the pattern the repo already trusts — the one behind
 * `i18n-bypass-scan` and `CLASS_B_AWAITING_A_DECISION`:
 *
 *   THE LIST CANNOT GROW.
 *
 *   · A NEW advisory fails the run. That is the property worth having: a
 *     dependency added today cannot bring a known vulnerability with it.
 *   · A KNOWN advisory is printed every run, with its severity and the reason
 *     it is still here. It cannot rot into blanket cover, because you read it
 *     on every push.
 *   · A known advisory that has DISAPPEARED also fails, and that is deliberate.
 *     A stale entry is a fix somebody already made and nobody recorded, and a
 *     baseline that only ever grows stops describing anything. Removing the
 *     line is part of the fix.
 *
 * The list is meant to shrink to zero. When it does, flip this to a plain
 * `--audit-level=high` and delete the baseline.
 *
 * Usage:  pnpm scan:deps          (needs network — the advisory DB is remote)
 * Exit 0 = no new advisories and no stale baseline entries.

/**
 * Advisories present when this gate was installed (2026-08-06, tip 7207d6ec).
 *
 * `note` is the reason it is still here — a path, or the work it is waiting on.
 *
 * BOTH PRODUCTION-PATH ENTRIES ARE GONE as of this bump, and that is the
 * ratchet's whole point rather than an aside. `drizzle-orm` (direct, 13
 * dependents, every service that touches Postgres) and `fast-uri` (transitive
 * under `fastify`, reached by every service) were the two that mattered. The
 * scan refused this PR until their lines were deleted — a fix nobody records
 * leaves a baseline describing a tree that no longer exists.
 *
 * What remains reaches no request path: it arrives through build or lint
 * tooling.
