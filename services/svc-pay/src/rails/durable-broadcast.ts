 *   2. sign (mine only)
 *   3. putSigned — persist signed bytes BEFORE any RPC broadcast
 *   4. eth_sendRawTransaction (or resume rebroadcast of the same bytes)
 *   5. put — journal the returned hash before waiting for inclusion
 *
 * A crash between (3) and (5) resumes via claim→`resume` and rebroadcasts the
 * identical signed payload. Rebroadcasting the same RLP is not a second spend.
