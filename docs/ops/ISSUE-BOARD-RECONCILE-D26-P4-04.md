# Issue board reconcile — D26-P4-04

**Board item:** D26-P4-04, [`DENON-HARD-PARALLEL-BOARD-2026-08-09.md`](../DENON-HARD-PARALLEL-BOARD-2026-08-09.md) §8 — _close shipped stubs; link issue → ADR → tracker._
**Lane:** `denon-d26-p4-04-issue-reconcile` (this row only).
**Tip at write:** `1723273b` (`origin/main`). Re-derive before acting again.
**Census:** `gh` / GitHub MCP `list_issues` on `Phantom-X-007/intafaced` — **35 open**, **0 previously closed**. AXIS A5 (`docs/AXIS-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN-2026-08-08.md`) already named the write-only board; this pass is the table, not a mass-close script.

## 0 · Rules used

- Close **only** generated tracker stubs whose mountain is tracker `done` **and** a **merged** PR unambiguously shipped that mountain.
- Do **not** close because AXIS guessed “eight”; do **not** close `ready` / `wip` / `socket` rows.
- Do **not** close Class X, Shehzad / `protocol-plane`, or human-decision issues.
- Do **not** edit `features.mjs` (P4-09).
- GitHub never used `Closes #N` on these stubs (`closed_by_pull_requests.total_count` was 0 on sampled issues). Proof is the merge record, not an auto-close link.

## 1 · Counts (this pass)

| Bucket | Count | Action |
| ------ | ----- | ------ |
| **Shipped — closed with proof PR** | **9** | Comment + `state_reason: completed` |
| **Still open** (real residual / not tracker-done) | **12** | Left open |
| **Left alone** (Shehzad / protocol-plane / Class X-adjacent) | **14** | No close, no spam comment |
| **Duplicate (noted, not closed)** | 2 GitHub overlaps, both Shehzad | See §4 |
| **Open after this pass** | **26** | 12 + 14 |

## 2 · Closed — shipped stubs (proof PR)

All nine were generated from `tooling/tracker/features.mjs` on 2026-07-27. Tracker row is `done`. Spec pack under `docs/ops/trk/` where one exists.

#8’s title still says “apps/web scaffold”. That path was deleted on purpose. Closing the stub does **not** reopen Vue craft (`nitro-frontend-all`).

## 3 · Still open — not tracker-done (or not a stub we can prove shipped)

| Issue | Tracker / topic | Status | ADR / spec | Why not closed |
| ----- | --------------- | ------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| [#4](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/issues/4) | `infra.i18n` | `ready` | `docs/ops/trk/infra.i18n.md` | Not `done`. Shell i18n is HUMAN Vue. |

| [#19](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/issues/19) | `ops.affiliates` | `wip` Denon | `docs/ops/trk/ops.affiliates.md` | Rates + producer wire residual (D26-P1-O2). |

| [#83](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/issues/83) | Stream A claim | coordination | `docs/NITRO-STREAM-A-CLAIM.md` · LIVE-LANES `nitro-frontend-all` | Checklist still open (S2 prices, visual sign-off). Not a tracker stub. |
| [#109](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/issues/109) | S2 market history seed | open need | `docs/STREAM-A-PHASE1-PLAN.md` | No merged PR that seeds honest non-zero history. |
| [#197](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/issues/197) | CI billing decision | human | retired spend-control docs; public-repo Actions law in `AGENTS.md` | **Premise obsolete** (repo public; hosted Actions free). Left open — owner billing issue, not an agent-completed stub. Candidate for Denon to close as not-planned. |

## 4 · Left alone — Shehzad / protocol-plane

Do not close. Agents babysit only. Handshake ADR: [`2026-08-08-protocol-plane-p0-handshake-and-rails.md`](../adr/2026-08-08-protocol-plane-p0-handshake-and-rails.md). Board: `docs/SHEHZAD-BLOCKCHAIN-TASK-BOARD-2026-08-03.md`.

| Issue | Tracker / topic | Note |
| ----- | --------------- | ---- |
| [#11](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/issues/11) | `protocol.smart-accounts` | `owner: shehzad002`. Overlaps **#927** Tier A (duplicate **noted**, not closed). |
| [#17](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/issues/17) | `mining.pool` | Shehzad. Overlaps **#934** Tier H (duplicate **noted**, not closed). |
| [#927](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/issues/927)–[#937](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/issues/937), [#956](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/issues/956) | chain Tiers A–L | Label `protocol-plane`. 12 issues. |

## 5 · What this pass did not do

- No `features.mjs` status flips (P4-09).
- No close of #18 despite #1494 — tracker still `ready`.
- No auto-reconciler script (AXIS A5 item 4). A script that closes on tracker `done` without a merge SHA would have been the spam-close this mountain forbids.
- No comments on the 26 issues left open.

## 6 · Leverage

Existing GitHub issue stubs + tracker registry + ADRs + merged PR records. No second issue tracker, no Vue, no `svc-edge` edit.
