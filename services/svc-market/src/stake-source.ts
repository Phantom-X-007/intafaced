/**
 * STAKE-GATED LISTING SLOTS (§8.7, `market.vendors` Stage 2).
 *
 * svc-token owns staking and owns the tier schedule. This service reads ONE
 * NUMBER off it — how many listing slots the caller's current tier entitles them
 * to — and compares it against how many they hold. It never stores that number:
 * a cached entitlement is a gate that keeps admitting somebody after they have
 * unstaked.
 *
 * ── FAILS CLOSED, ON EVERY PATH ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Network throw, non-2xx, a payload that is not the shape expected, a
 * `vendorSlots` that is not a non-negative integer — all four refuse with
 * `market.stake_unavailable`. Admitting on an unreadable stake would hand every
 * vendor unlimited slots for the length of an outage, which is precisely the
 * outage during which nobody would be watching the marketplace.
 *
 * Unlike svc-academy's equivalent, there is no half of this service that skips
 * the check: every slot claim is stake-gated, so svc-token being down closes the
 * claim path entirely. That is the correct trade — a slot claimed during an
 * outage is a listing nobody can prove was entitled.
 *
 * ── THE INTERNAL ENDPOINT, NOT THE tRPC PROCEDURE ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `token.stakeOf` / `token.accessOf` are `scopedProcedure('token:read')` and
 * SELF-ONLY: they resolve the caller's own principal, which svc-market does not
 * hold. `GET /internal/stake/:userId` is the only surface that exposes the whole
 * `AccessTier` — and therefore `vendorSlots` — across a service boundary.
 *
 * ── NO AMOUNT CROSSES THIS BOUNDARY, AND THAT IS ON PURPOSE ─────────────────
 *
 * The response also carries `staked` and `tier.minStake` as decimal strings.
 * This service reads NEITHER. It needs a capacity, not a balance, and svc-market
 * has no `@intafaced/ledger-client` dependency precisely so that no code path
 * here can hold or emit an amount (§0.6). Not parsing them is also the safest
 * possible position on the bug PR #1100 fixed: `staked` used to be emitted as
 * `Amount.toString()` — the raw scaled integer — and a consumer that re-scaled
 * it with `parseAmount` would read a stake 10^18 too large and admit everybody.
 * A field that is never read cannot be double-scaled.
 *
 * ── DEPENDS ON PR #1100 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Until that merges, `/internal/stake/:userId` returns HTTP 500 to every caller:
 * `AccessTier.minStake` is a bigint and Fastify's `JSON.stringify` fallback
 * throws on one. The code below is correct either way — a 500 is a non-2xx and
 * refuses — but no slot can be claimed in an environment built before that fix.
