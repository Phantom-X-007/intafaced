/**
 * BYBIT SPOT — the SECOND venue, and the first thing that makes grading mean
 * anything.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY A SECOND VENUE AT ALL, AND WHY THIS ONE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `latency.ts` claims §27's *"every adapter continuously scored … feeding
 * execution routing weights live"*, and `cross-check.ts` claims a median across
 * venues catches the venue that is fresh, sequenced and simply WRONG. Neither
 * claim can be true with one adapter: a grade with nothing to rank against is a
 * number, and a median of one is that one venue's opinion of itself. So the
 * second adapter is not "more coverage" — it is the thing that turns two
 * already-written mechanisms from plausible into checkable.
 *
 * Bybit spot, specifically, for four reasons that are properties of its API
 * rather than preferences:
 *
 *   · **Everything on the wire is a decimal STRING** — book levels, sizes, trade
 *     prints, tick sizes, order minimums — on REST *and* on the websocket. That
 *     matters more than it sounds. `decimal.ts` REFUSES a JSON number, correctly,
 *     and several otherwise-excellent public feeds publish floats in their depth
 *     stream, which would leave `streamBook` able only to throw. A venue whose
 *     own encoding already agrees with Doctrine 5 is a venue we can read without
 *     negotiating with it.
 *   · **Its REST book carries an update id (`u`), and so do its websocket
 *     frames.** That is what lets the EXISTING `SequencedBookTracker` and
 *     `MaintainedBook` drive this adapter unchanged — subscribe, buffer,
 *     snapshot, join, gap-detect — instead of a second, parallel book path with
 *     its own bugs. Venues that number only their stream (or only publish a
 *     checksum) cannot be joined to a REST snapshot at all, and would have
 *     forced either a second book implementation or an honest `sequenced: false`
 *     that made this venue useless for cross-checking Binance.
 *   · **Public market data needs no key**, so the whole of this file is
 *     verifiable against the real venue by anyone with egress — and none of it
 *     touches a credential.
 *   · **Its depth deltas are absolute totals with `"0"` as the only encoding of
 *     removal**, which is already the `VenueBookDelta` contract. No translation,
 *     so nothing to get subtly wrong.
 *
 * No SDK, no `ccxt`, no `bybit-api` package: §27 forbids a third-party
 * connectivity library in the money path, and this file talks to the documented
 * public HTTP and WS surface through the same `HttpPort`/`StreamPort` seam the
 * first venue uses.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHERE BYBIT DIFFERS FROM BINANCE, AND WHY EACH DIFFERENCE IS LOAD-BEARING
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * These are not cosmetic. Each one is a way the Binance-shaped assumption would
 * have failed silently here:
 *
 *   1. **It subscribes by MESSAGE, not by URL.** Binance encodes the stream in
 *      the path and never speaks; Bybit opens one socket and sends
 *      `{"op":"subscribe","args":[…]}`. A socket we opened and never subscribed
 *      on is open, healthy and permanently silent — identical, in every metric
 *      here, to a quiet market. Hence `StreamHandle.send`, and hence the loud
 *      refusal below when a transport cannot provide it.
 *   2. **It requires a heartbeat.** The docs say ping every 20 seconds. Without
 *      it the venue closes the connection, which this fabric would read as the
 *      venue going away — an outage we caused.
 *   3. **It reports rate limiting inside a `200`.** `retCode` 10006/10018 in an
 *      otherwise successful HTTP response. An adapter that only inspected the
 *      status line would keep asking and get IP-banned.
 *   4. **There is no `Retry-After`.** Binance tells us when to come back; Bybit
 *      answers `403 access too frequent` and its documentation says to stop and
 *      wait *at least ten minutes*. So the backoff here is a documented floor
 *      rather than a parsed header — see `BYBIT_IP_BACKOFF_MS`.
 *   5. **A partial subscribe rejection arrives with `success: true`.** The
 *      rejected topics are in `data.failTopics`. Checking `success` alone — the
 *      obvious reading — would leave us waiting forever on a topic the venue
 *      already refused. See `subscribeRefusal`.
 *   6. **`orderbook.1` on spot is snapshot-only**, so it cannot be used as a
 *      delta feed at all. `DEFAULT_WS_DEPTH` is 50 for that reason, not for tuning.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * TRADING / ACCOUNT — signed, observation-only balances
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Signed place/cancel/fetch lives in `bybit-spot-trade.ts`. Signed SPOT wallet
 * observation lives in `bybit-spot-account.ts`. transferRails stays not_ready.
 * No live key is invented. Public market data still needs none.
 *
 * The fee schedule is Bybit's published non-VIP spot default and is marked
 * `indicative: true` for the reason `market.ts` gives: the rate an ACCOUNT pays
 * depends on its VIP tier, which needs a key to read, and a route costed on
 * defaults for an account that pays more is wrong against the user.
