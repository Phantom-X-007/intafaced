# TRK-p2p.merchants — research / spec pack

**Tracker id:** `p2p.merchants`  
**Title:** P2P merchant programme — badges, limits, API  
**Module / phase:** `p2p` · phase 3 · plane F  
**Status on tip:** ready · **owner:** none  
**Depends on:** `p2p.reputation` (done)  
**Requires:** `services/svc-p2p` extension — table not built  
**Tip freeze:** `origin/main` @ `04f9b1f2` (re-derive before implement)  
**Pack type:** research only — no implement swarm; no money invention; **no** `features.mjs` edit from this pack.

## 1 · What “done” means (plain language)

1. Merchants get **badges, limits, and API access** as a programme distinct from ordinary P2P users.
2. Limits and badges derive from **reputation + explicit programme rules**, not a fresh account borrowing merchant trust (reputation code already warns this).
3. `p2p_merchants` table (§6.2 fifth table) arrives with its **own migration** — no half-written table left behind.
4. Merchant API keys/scopes are revocable; actions still go through escrow/ledger doctrine.
5. Open Denon P2P money PRs (e.g. payment instruments) are not dual-edited for badges.

## 2 · Current code state (tip)

### 2.1 Reputation done; merchants table not

| Fact       | Tip                                                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| svc-p2p    | Offers, escrow, disputes, reputation on main                                          |
| README     | Explicit: `p2p_merchants` is tracker `p2p.merchants` and **not built**; no half table |
| Reputation | Guards against rendering zero-history as flawless merchant trust                      |
| Open PRs   | e.g. #428 payment instruments — path intersect before edit                            |

Clean extension point.

## 3 · Doctrine constraints

| Law          | Implication                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| §6.2         | p2p_merchants fifth table                                |
| Escrow/money | Still ledger + p2p recipes; merchants not a side balance |
| Reputation   | No trust borrow for fresh accounts                       |
| Agent thrift | One service PR: svc-p2p only                             |

## 4 · DoD sketch (checkable — staged)

### Stage 1 — schema + apply

- [ ] p2p_merchants migration + apply/approve state machine

### Stage 2 — badges + limits

- [ ] Enforce limits on offer create
- [ ] Badge read on public profile

### Stage 3 — merchant API

- [ ] Scoped tokens; rate limits; audit

**Tracker `done`:** badges + limits enforced + API or explicit cut of API to later row.

## 5 · Open questions

1. Badge tiers and numeric limits — product law?
2. API required for v1 or UI-only merchants?
3. Stake requirement?
