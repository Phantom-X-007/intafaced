 * THE INGEST LOOP — follow the chain, and repair the projection when it forks.

 * Three jobs, in order of how much they matter:
 *
 *   1. notice that the chain we projected is no longer the chain that exists
 *   2. find where the two diverged
 *   3. delete what the dead branch wrote, and carry on from the fork
 *
 * (1) is the one everybody skips. An indexer that only ever asks "what is the
 * next block?" will happily extend a branch that no longer exists, because the
 * source will keep answering. So every pass re-reads the block at OUR OWN head
 * and compares hashes before it asks for anything newer. That single extra read
 * is the difference between a projection that repairs itself and one that
 * quietly serves a price from a branch nobody else can see.
