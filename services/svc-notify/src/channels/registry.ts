/**
 * WHICH CHANNELS EXIST, AND WHICH ONE CAN ACTUALLY REACH ANYONE.
 *
 * Every channel is always registered. A channel with no credentials is
 * registered as an `UnconfiguredChannel`, not left out — because a missing key
 * in a map is indistinguishable from a channel nobody has written yet, and this
 * service has to be able to say "email exists, it is not wired, here is the env
 * var you are missing" to an operator reading `/ready`.
 *
 * The in-app inbox is always available and is the honest fallback (§13): if the
 * owner has obtained no credentials at all, users still get every notification,
 * in the app, and every out-of-app channel says on the record why it did not
 * send. That is a working notification system with three refusals — not a
 * broken one pretending.
 *
 * REFUSING IS THE DEFAULT, NOT THE POLICY
 *
 * "The channel refuses honestly" is the right answer in dev, in test, and for a
 * channel the operator has decided not to wire. It is the WRONG answer for a
 * channel a production deployment depends on — an operator who believes SMS
 * margin calls are going out, and whose delivery table quietly disagrees, is in
 * the same position as the borrower.
 *
 * So the operator declares the channels that must work, in
 * `NOTIFY_REQUIRED_CHANNELS`, and a required channel with no credentials is
 * fatal — here at construction and, before that, in `env.ts` at boot. Same
 * posture as `EDGE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET`: no default, and a process that cannot do
 * the job it was deployed for does not start and pretend.
