/**
 * svc-support — durable tickets in Postgres (schema `support`).
 * DATABASE_URL is required (serviceEnvSchema) so the desk survives restarts
 * and multi-replica claims stay exclusive. Still no ledger, and never one.
 *
 * INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET is now required, and the reason is narrow: reading
 * account state from svc-identity is an S2S call and `/internal/account/:userId`
 * hard-401s an unauthenticated caller. Required rather than optional because a
 * desk that boots without it looks healthy and then reports every account as
 * unread — a degraded mode that is indistinguishable, from the operator's
 * chair, from every account genuinely being unreadable. Refusing to start says
 * it once, loudly, at deploy time. (`compose-secret-parity` holds the other
 * half: the compose block must actually supply it.)
 *
 * IDENTITY_URL is optional with a dev default, matching `svc-trade`. It is not
 * a secret and a missing one is a wrong address, not a silent authority hole.
