/**
 * ENTRY HISTORY — the read behind svc-bank's spend view (§8.1).
 *
 * A spend breakdown is a PROJECTION over movements that already exist in this
 * book. svc-bank does not keep `spent_this_month` counters (that would be a
 * second source of truth for money in everything but name), so it folds this
 * read on demand. Its adapter (`svc-bank/src/ledger-client.ts`) was written
 * against this shape before it existed here, and deliberately refuses rather
 * than falling back to an empty answer — a spend view that
 * silently reports zero is worse than one that is unavailable, because the user
 * cannot tell "you spent nothing" from "we could not ask".
 *
 * THIS IS A READ, AND ONLY A READ. It touches no balance, takes no chain-tip
 * lock, and has no path into `post()`. The one way it could become a second
 * write door is by growing a parameter that changes what is stored; it has
 * none, and must not.
 *
 *
 * THE BOUND, AND WHY IT REFUSES INSTEAD OF TRUNCATING.
 *
 * An account with a long enough history would otherwise hand the service an
 * unbounded row set to buffer and JSON-encode — one request is enough to exhaust
 * the heap of the process that owns every balance in the OS. So the read is
 * capped at `HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES`.
 *
 * A cap has two possible behaviours and only one of them is honest. Returning
 * the first N entries produces an array indistinguishable from a complete one:
 * svc-bank would sum it, call the total "your spending this month", and be
 * wrong by however much fell off the end, with nothing anywhere saying so. That
 * is the same failure as the empty fallback its adapter already refuses, in
 * different clothing — a plausible number nobody can tell is short.
 *
 * So the cap is visible by construction: over it, this read REFUSES, naming the
 * cap and the window it was asked for. `ledger.history_range_too_large`
 * rehydrates through `rehydrateLedgerHttpError` as a typed `LedgerError` at the
 * caller, so svc-bank surfaces "unavailable, narrow the range" rather than a
 * quietly short total. The refusal is actionable: the same window in halves is
 * two requests that each answer.
 *
 * The query asks for `HISTORY_MAX_ENTRIES + 1` rows for exactly this reason —
 * one row is enough to know the answer would have been clipped, and it is the
 * cheapest possible way to know it. Memory stays bounded whether the read
 * answers or refuses.
 *
 * NOT PAGINATION, DELIBERATELY. A cursor is the right shape for a history the
 * user browses; nothing asks for one yet, and a `limit` without a cursor is just
 * silent truncation with a parameter in front of it. §13 socket: when a paged
 * history is needed, add `after: <entry id>` and page on `(posted_at, e.id)`,
 * which `ledger_entries_account_idx` already orders.
 *
 * THIS DOOR DOES NOT INVENT THAT FIELD. A caller that sends `after` or `cursor`
 * is asking for a page we do not serve. Zod's default strip would drop it and
 * answer the first window as if it were complete — the same lie as truncating
 * at the cap. `refuseHistoryCursor` names the socket instead.

 * this refuses at the point where a caller is asking for a year of one, which is
 * a question for a paged history rather than for a single analytics fold.
