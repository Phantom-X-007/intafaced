/**
 * SERVICE-TO-SERVICE AUTHENTICATION (§2, §9).
 *
 * Distinct from the edge principal, and needed for a different reason.
 *
 * `packages/auth` deliberately has no `ledger:write` scope: a user token must
 * never be able to move value directly. svc-ledger's `post` documented that as
 * the reason it was safe —
 *
 *     "there is no user-facing write ... which is why packages/auth has no
 *      ledger:write scope at all"
 *
 * — and then declared `post` a `publicProcedure`. The reasoning is inverted.
 * `publicProcedure` does not check a scope, so the ABSENCE of `ledger:write`
 * protects nothing; it just means there is no scope left to check. Every one of
 * the six services calling svc-ledger over HTTP sent `content-type` and nothing
 * else, so there was no credential to verify either.
 *
 * The consequence, once svc-ledger is mounted: anyone who can reach the port
 * posts a balanced two-entry transaction crediting `railBoundary` (a `treasury`
 * account, and treasury is the one owner type allowed to run negative) and
 * debiting their own `available`. That is the `deposit` recipe. Every invariant
 * passes — sum-to-zero, non-negative, paired locks — because the transaction is
 * genuinely well-formed. It is simply not authorised, and nothing was asking.
 *
 * So callers now prove which service they are.
 *
 * ── L2-6: the body IS signed now. What changed, and why ──────────────────────
 *
 * The first cut signed `${service}\n${timestamp}` and NOT the request body. It
 * said so, and said why: body signing needs the raw bytes at verification time,
 * and Fastify has already parsed and discarded them by the time a handler or a
 * tRPC context runs. That deferral was the right call in a hurry; it was also a
 * real hole. Within the 300-second window a captured signature was replayable
 * against **any body on any procedure of that service** — and the S2S surfaces
 * include svc-ledger's `/trpc/post` and svc-matching's order writes, so a
 * replayable signature was a replayable money instruction.
 *
 * Two schemes therefore exist, and exactly two:
 *
 *   **v1 (legacy)**  preimage `${service}\n${timestamp}`.
 *                    No body digest header. Kept only so the fleet can be
 *                    redeployed one service at a time. Provides identity and a
 *                    replay bound; provides NO body integrity.
 *
 *   **v2**           preimage per `serviceCallPreimage` below, over
 *                    (service, timestamp, sha256(raw body)).
 *                    The digest travels in `SERVICE_BODY_DIGEST_HEADER`, and its
 *                    PRESENCE is the version marker. There is no fourth
 *                    "version" header, because a header whose only content is a
 *                    restatement of another header's presence is one more thing
 *                    to keep in sync for no gain.
 *
 * ── Why length-prefixing rather than another newline ─────────────────────────
 *
 * v1 used a newline so `('ab', 1)` and `('a', 11)` could not share a preimage.
 * With three fields that reasoning gets thinner: `service` is entirely
 * caller-controlled and may contain a newline, so a bare `\n` join is injective
 * only because of validation living elsewhere in this file — the timestamp must
 * parse as an integer, the digest must be 64 hex characters. That is an
 * invariant held at a distance. One relaxed validator, or one added field, and
 * the framing silently stops being unambiguous.
 *
 * So each field is length-prefixed (`<byteLength>:<value>\n`). The encoding is
 * injective on its own terms: no field's content can be read as a delimiter or
 * as part of a neighbouring field, whatever it contains. Byte length, not
 * character length, so a multi-byte service name cannot shift the frame.
 *
 * The scheme also carries a domain tag (`intafaced-s2s-v2`). That makes v1 and
 * v2 preimages disjoint by construction, which is what makes `accept-both` a
 * migration window rather than a second hole: a captured v1 signature can never
 * be reinterpreted as a v2 signature, or the reverse.
 *
 * ── The honest limit of `accept-both` ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * In `accept-both` a verifier still accepts a v1 call, so an active attacker who
 * captures a v2 call can strip the digest header and downgrade to v1 — regaining
 * exactly the replay this change closes. **`accept-both` buys a migration with
 * no outage. It does not buy body integrity.** The security property exists only
 * under `require`. `docs/decisions/s2s-body-bind.md` has the flip procedure and
 * the signal that says it is safe.
 *
 * Still recorded rather than hidden, and deliberately NOT in this change:
 *
 *   · **Per-service keypairs.** Every service shares one secret today, so any
 *     service can mint any other service's signature. Body binding does not help
 *     with that and neither does v2 framing. It is a key-distribution and
 *     rotation problem — different design, different blast radius — and it wants
 *     its own PR rather than being half-done alongside this one.
 *   · **Binding the method and path.** Body binding stops "any body"; it stops
 *     "any procedure" only narrowly, since two procedures can accept
 *     structurally similar bodies. Binding the request target is the completion
 *     and it is cheap in code — but it breaks the fleet the first time anything
 *     between two services rewrites a path, so it needs a survey of the proxy
 *     and mount topology first. The length-prefixed framing exists precisely so
 *     that adding a fourth field later is a clean `v3` and not a collision risk.
