/**
 * CARDS (§8.1) — the LEDGER half: authorise, hold, capture, reverse, cash back.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THIS SERVICE ADDS NO RECIPE, AND THAT IS THE INTERESTING PART
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A card spend is a WITHDRAWAL. That sentence is the whole design, and once it
 * is said out loud the four recipes this module needs already exist:
 *
 *   authorisation approved  `withdrawHold`     available → hold, one account
 *                                              per authorisation
 *   capture (clearing)      `withdrawSettle`   hold → rail boundary; the value
 *                                              leaves our book
 *   the unspent remainder   `withdrawReverse`  hold → available, defined rather
 *                                              than improvised
 *   cashback                `rewardPay`        rewards engine → available
 *
 * The staging is not a convenience — it is what makes "authorised but not yet
 * captured" a BALANCE somebody can read (`withdrawalHoldAccount(user, asset,
 * authId)`) instead of an incident to be reconstructed. It is the same argument
 * `merchantClearing` makes for payments and `loanCollateralAccount` makes for
 * collateral, and it is why a partial capture here is two postings and not one
 * adjusted number: the merchant takes what they charged, the remainder goes
 * back, and the hold account ends at exactly zero.
 *
 * A new recipe would have been the wrong instinct twice over. `packages/ledger-
 * client` is owner carve-out territory, and more to the point a `cardSpend`
 * recipe would have been `withdrawSettle` with a different string in it — a
 * second way to spell one movement, which is how two subsystems come to
 * disagree about what happened.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * IF THE PROCESS DIES EXACTLY HERE, WHOSE FUNDS ARE STRANDED?
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── authorize(): decide, claim, THEN hold ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   after the decision row, before the hold post
 *     The authorisation is `approved` and `pending` with no ledger transaction.
 *     Nothing has moved and nothing is stranded: the user's funds are still
 *     their own available balance. A redelivered webhook re-drives it, and the
 *     post is idempotent on `withdraw.hold:<authorisation uuid>`, so it finds the
 *     original transaction or makes it once.
 *
 *   after the hold post, before the row is marked settled
 *     The funds are in a hold account keyed to THIS authorisation — an account
 *     the ledger says belongs to the user. The record catches up on re-drive.
 *     The worst case is a hold nobody captures, which `reverse()` returns.
 *
 *   THE REVERSE ORDER IS THE BUG. Hold-then-decide would post against an
 *   authorisation that has no row, so a crash would leave value in an account
 *   whose key nothing on this side can reconstruct.
 *
 * ── capture(): capture and reverse are two posts, and both must happen ───────
 *
 *   after the capture, before the remainder is returned
 *     The merchant has been paid and the user's unspent remainder is still in
 *     the hold account. Visible — `cards.test.ts` reads that account directly —
 *     and returned by `resumeSettlements`, which re-drives the reversal for the
 *     amount its row was claimed with. Nothing is lost; something is late.
 *
 *     NOT by re-driving `capture`. That was claimed here for a while and it was
 *     never true: a settled sequence 0 closes the authorisation, so the re-drive
 *     is refused `bank.card_authorization_closed` before either post is reached,
 *     and the repo's own test asserts that refusal. A recovery story that only
 *     exists in a comment is worse than an admitted gap — it is why the loans
 *     module has `resumePendingLoans` as a CALL and not as a paragraph.
 *
 *     They are NOT one posting, unlike the loan seizure. The argument that made
 *     a liquidation atomic was that the borrower could spend inside the window;
 *     here the window contains value the user CANNOT reach — it is in a hold —
 *     so splitting it costs a delay and buys two independently auditable facts.
 *
 * ── cashback(): after the money moved, and allowed to fail on its own ────────
 *
 *   Cashback is paid on a CAPTURE, never on an authorisation, because an
 *   authorisation that is later reversed is a purchase that did not happen and
 *   the reward would have to be clawed back from a balance the user may have
 *   already spent. Paying late is honest; taking money back is not a thing this
 *   service can do.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 *   · A LIVE RAIL. `socket.live-issuer` — a card-scheme sponsor and an issuing
 *     BIN. See `issuer.ts`, which is the seam, and states at length what
 *     `card-sim` is not.
 *   · REFUNDS. A merchant-initiated refund is value re-entering the book over
 *     the rail (`recipes.deposit`, rail `card-sim`), and it is not built here
 *     because it brings a question this module has not answered: whether the
 *     cashback paid on the original capture is clawed back. It is a product
 *     decision with a real answer either way, and inventing one to make a
 *     module look finished is how a card programme ends up paying for purchases
 *     that were returned.
 *   · DISPUTES AND CHARGEBACKS. A scheme process, downstream of a scheme.
 *   · INCREMENTAL AUTHORISATIONS, and any multi-capture flow. One capture per
 *     authorisation, enforced by `unique(authorization_id, sequence)` plus the
 *     closed check. Hotel and fuel flows need the first; they also need a live
 *     rail to be worth having.
 *   · FRAUD SCORING, velocity limits, 3-D Secure, MCC policy. All of it belongs
 *     to a rail, and none of it is simulated here — a decline in this module is
 *     always one of four named reasons and never a score.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * JUST-IN-TIME CONVERSION (§18) — WHAT IT CHANGED HERE, AND WHAT IT DID NOT
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A card may now be charged in a SETTLEMENT asset that is not the asset it draws
 * on, which is what §18's "spend pulls exact fiat equivalent via just-in-time
 * conversion" describes and what this module previously had no way to express.
 *
 * WHAT DID NOT CHANGE IS THE MONEY PATH. There is still one asset on our book —
 * the funding asset — moving available → hold → rail through the same three
 * recipes, and this file still adds no recipe. A conversion decides the SIZE of
 * that movement and is not a second movement; `conversion.ts` argues that at
 * length, including why booking the counterparty's leg would be a second book.
 *
 * Three consequences worth having in one place:
 *
 *   · `authorize()` and `capture()` take amounts in the SETTLEMENT asset — the
 *     merchant's number, which is the only number the merchant has. On a
 *     same-asset card the two are the same asset and nothing about the call
 *     changes.
 *   · `card_authorizations.amount` is the FUNDING amount, because that is what
 *     the hold, the capture and the reversal are all denominated in. A column
 *     that sometimes meant one asset and sometimes another is how a reversal
 *     comes to return the wrong number.
 *   · The rate is quoted ONCE and frozen in the same transaction as the
 *     decision. `capture()` re-reads it and never re-quotes, so a rate that
 *     moves between the swipe and the clearing cannot settle a different number
 *     of units than were held.
 *
 * And the refusal that matters most: with no rate adapter configured — which is
 * every deployment, because this platform has no FX source — a card that needs a
 * conversion refuses `bank.mark_missing` and writes nothing. It does not decline
 * (a decline is an answer, and nobody answered), and it does not invent a rate.
