/**
 * THE MAINTAINED BOOK — subscribe, buffer, snapshot, and resnapshot on a gap.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS THE WHOLE FILE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * 1. **Open the stream.**
 * 2. **Buffer everything it sends.**
 * 3. **Then** fetch the snapshot.
 * 4. Join, checking that the buffered stream is contiguous with the snapshot.
 * 5. If it is not — the snapshot predates the buffer — fetch a NEWER snapshot
 *    and try again. Do not go live.
 *
 * Snapshot-then-subscribe is the obvious order and it is wrong. Updates that
 * land between the fetch and the subscription are lost, and they are lost with
 * NO sequence discontinuity afterwards, because the snapshot's sequence is
 * already past them. Every delta that follows is contiguous with every other
 * delta, the gap detector reports a healthy book forever, and the book is
 * missing whatever changed in that window.
 *
 * That is the single most expensive bug available in this package, and the only
 * defence is doing these five steps in this order.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * RESNAPSHOTTING IS BOUNDED
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A venue that is genuinely broken will gap, resnapshot, and gap again — and an
 * unbounded loop turns that into a request storm that gets us rate-limited or
 * banned, which is an outage we caused on top of the venue's. `maxResyncs`
 * caps it: past the cap the feed STOPS and reports, rather than fighting.
 *
 * A stopped feed is a venue that is excluded and reported (§27). A feed that
 * keeps hammering is a venue that is excluded, unreported, and taking the rest
 * of the fabric's rate limit with it.
