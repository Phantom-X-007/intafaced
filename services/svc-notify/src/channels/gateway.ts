/**
 * THE OUT-OF-APP TRANSPORT — the half that email, push and SMS share.
 *
 * Each of the three reaches the world the same way: one authenticated HTTP POST
 * to a URL the owner configures. Whoever answers that URL — a mail relay, a push
 * service, an SMS aggregator, or the owner's own forwarder — is configuration.
 * This file cannot name them and must not: §0.7 keeps partner names out of
 * shipped code, and a hard-coded vendor SDK would also make "swap the provider"
 * a code change instead of an env change (§0.4).
 *
 * What each channel does NOT share is the shape of an address and the shape of a
 * message. A mailbox is not a handset is not a device token, and a body that is
 * fine in an email is three billed segments over SMS. Those differences live in
 * `adapters.ts`, one subclass each, and this class holds nothing but the wire.
 *
 * WHY NOT A VENDOR SDK
 *
 * Three SDKs would be three dependency trees, three retry semantics, three
 * credential shapes and three names the brand scan would have to allow. One POST
 * with an idempotency key is a smaller, honest surface, and the owner can put
 * anything behind it. The cost is real and stated: the owner must run or buy
 * something that speaks it. That cost is named in the README and in
 * `docs/OWNER-ACTIONS-NOTIFY-GATEWAYS.md`, not hidden.
 *
 * WHAT IT SENDS
 *
 *   POST <gateway url>
 *   authorization: Bearer <token>
 *   idempotency-key: <notificationId>:<channel>
 *   content-type: application/json
 *   { channel, notificationId, to, locale, severity, kind, titleKey, bodyKey,
 *     …per-channel fields }
 *
 * Copy is rendered before it gets here, so a gateway needs no catalog. The keys
 * ride along for a gateway that has its own templates.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER DOES
 *
 * It never returns a receipt it did not earn. Every path out of `deliver()` is
 * either a receipt backed by a 2xx from the gateway, a `ChannelRefusal`, or a
 * `ChannelDeliveryError`. There is no catch that swallows, no default that
 * shrugs, and no timeout that resolves. If this service cannot prove a transport
 * took the message, it says so and the delivery row says so.
