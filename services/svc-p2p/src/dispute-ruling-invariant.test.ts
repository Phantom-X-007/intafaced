/**
 * A DISPUTED ESCROW TERMINATES ONLY ON AN ATTRIBUTED HUMAN RULING.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS SUITE TOUCHES NO TYPESCRIPT AT ALL
 *
 * The two bypasses this exists for are both reachable without calling a single
 * method of `P2pService`. `state.ts` already forbids `disputed → escrowed`, and
 * `resolveDispute` already refuses to be called by anything without a
 * moderator's session — and neither of those facts is what protects the escrow,
 * because a migration, a fix-up script, a psql session or the next writer in
 * this service does not go through either of them. A service-level test of this
 * invariant proves the service is polite. It says nothing about the invariant.
 *
 * So every statement below is raw SQL against the real schema. If the trigger is
 * the thing holding the line, this is the only place the line can be measured.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT WAS ACTUALLY REPRODUCED, before drizzle/0003
 *
 * Against `0000` + `0001`, four escrows terminated with the dispute row still
 * `open` or ruled by a machine, and the gate stayed green throughout:
 *
 *   cancelled/refunded  dispute open      ruled by (none)
 *   cancelled/refunded  dispute resolved  ruled by System:p2p-backstop
 *   cancelled/refunded  dispute resolved  ruled by automation:p2p
 *   cancelled/refunded  dispute resolved  ruled by p2p-backstop
 *
 * The first is the two-step un-dispute: `disputed → escrowed` (the trigger
 * fires and sleeps, `NEW.resolution` is NULL), then `escrowed → cancelled` with
 * a resolution (`OLD.status` is no longer `disputed`, so it never fires). The
 * other three are one case-sensitive `LIKE 'system:%'` denylist meeting three
 * spellings it did not enumerate.
 *
 * H8a PG-hard: this file never `describe.skip` / `postgresAvailable`. CI uses
 * TEST_DATABASE_URL (per-run database via `createTestDatabase` so schema-qualified
 * `p2p.*` SQL stays on `p2p`). Local without that env starts Testcontainers
 * `postgres:16-alpine`. Docker/PG down is a failed suite, not a green skip.
