/**
 * svc-notify — event-driven fan-out (ops.notifications).
 *
 * Phase 5. In-app inbox, plus email / push / SMS behind one internal adapter
 * interface (§0.4). This process holds no balance (§0.6) and posts no ledger
 * transaction: it moves messages, not money.
 *
 * WHAT AN OPERATOR SHOULD READ ON BOOT
 *
 * `/ready` reports two things that are easy to get wrong and expensive to
 * discover late:
 *
 *   channels          which transports have credentials (`configured`), which
 *                     ones this deployment declared it DEPENDS ON, and the env
 *                     vars each missing one needs. URL+token is unprobed, not
 *                     available — this process does not POST at boot. A channel
 *                     with none is not "off" — it refuses every message with a
 *                     code that lands on the delivery record.
 *   pendingConsumers  subjects whose stream does not exist yet because the
 *                     producing service has not connected a bus. Nothing is
 *                     lost — the durable consumer attaches on a later boot and
 *                     JetStream replays the stream from the start — but it is
 *                     stated rather than left to be noticed.
 *
 * WHAT AN OPERATOR WILL NEVER READ HERE
 *
 * A required channel that is not wired. `env.ts` refuses to load in that state,
 * so this file is not reached — see NOTIFY_REQUIRED_CHANNELS. The unavailable
 * warnings below are therefore only ever about channels the operator chose not
 * to depend on.
