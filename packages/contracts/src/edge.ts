/**
 * THE EDGE TRUST BOUNDARY (§9).
 *
 * Every authorisation decision in the OS reads `ctx.principal` — scope, tier,
 * MFA, jurisdiction. None of them re-derive it. So whatever puts a principal on
 * the context is, in effect, the entire authorisation model.
 *
 * A mounted service does not parse tokens (§4.1 owns that); the edge terminates
 * auth and forwards the resolved principal in a header. That is a sound design
 * with exactly one precondition:
 *
 *   **the header is only worth anything if the caller cannot forge it.**
 *
 * `JSON.parse(req.headers['x-intafaced-principal'])` does not meet that bar. It
 * lets anyone who can reach the port assert any user id, any scope set, any KYC
 * tier, and `mfa: true` — which is not "a public procedure is exposed", it is
 * every procedure simultaneously, including the ones guarding withdrawals.
 *
 * So the header is signed. The edge HMACs the exact bytes it forwards; the
 * service verifies before it believes anything. Network placement stops being
 * the only thing between a caller and a withdrawal.
