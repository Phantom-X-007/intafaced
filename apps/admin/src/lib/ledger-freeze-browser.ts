/**
 * Browser-side hop to this app's own `/api/ledger-freeze` route.
 *
 * The mirror of `control-plane-browser.ts`, and it exists for the same reason:
 * `ADMIN_TREASURY_TOKEN` stays on the server. A board that called svc-edge
 * directly would have to ship a token carrying `admin:treasury` — the authority
 * to halt ALL value movement — into a bundle.
 *
 * ── Why this file is new and the route is not ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `src/app/api/ledger-freeze/route.ts` has been a complete, correct BFF since
 * #186: it validates, it forwards, and it passes svc-ledger's failures through
 * with their own status instead of flattening them to 200. It had ZERO callers.
 * `/ledger` rendered `src/lib/operator-commands.ts` instead — stubs whose own
 * header said "They do NOT call them" — so the console had two freeze paths, one
 * real and unreachable, one reachable and fake, and the screen an operator opens
 * during an incident was the fake one.
 *
 * There is now one path.
