/**
 * Certifications Stage-2 — THE EMIT THAT WAS RESIDUAL (TRK-academy.certs §4).
 *
 * `xp-policy.ts` decided what a cert is worth and `xp-emit.ts` decided what the
 * payload looks like, and then nothing published either one: both modules were
 * imported by nothing but their own tests, and `index.ts` said in as many words
 * that svc-academy holds no bus because "the §8.3 event this service would
 * eventually emit is `intafaced.identity.xp.earned` on certification, and
 * certification ships with the curriculum." Certification has shipped. This file
 * is the wire.
 *
 * ── What it is NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * NOT a rank writer. svc-identity is the only writer to `rank_state` (§4.1) and
 * the only consumer of this event; academy publishes and forgets. NOT money: XP
 * is an integer on the catalog schema, no `Amount`, no ledger client, no
 * balance — `academy` stays `custodial: false`.
 *
 * ── Why re-publishing is safe, and why that is the recovery story ───────────
 *
 * The idempotency key is a business key — `academy.cert:cert:<userId>:<certId>`,
 * derived in `xp-policy.ts` from the grant itself, never a random uuid. Identity
 * inserts `xp_events ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) DO NOTHING`, so the SECOND
 * delivery of a cert award changes nothing. That is what lets `grantCert` emit
 * on an already-granted cert as well as a fresh one: if the bus was down the
 * first time, calling grant again re-emits and the user gets their XP; if it was
 * up, the re-emit is a no-op at the writer. An outbox table would buy the same
 * guarantee for the price of a table, a sweep and a migration.
