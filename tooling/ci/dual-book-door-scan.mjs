 * Dual-book door-kill registration scan (Plan P2-4 · Spec DB-2 · Architect A1).

 * Does not prove a running JVM — that is residual until a Spring boot smoke exists.

/**
 * THE REGISTRATION, not the word.
 *
 * This check used to be `text.includes('DualBookMoneyDoorInterceptor')` over the
 * whole file. Every one of these configs also carries an `import` line naming
 * the interceptor class — so the import ALONE satisfied it. Proved by taking the
 * door off its hinges in memory and re-running the old check:
 *
 *     registration line still present after gutting?               false
 *     old check  text.includes("DualBookMoneyDoorInterceptor") ->  true
 *     what still satisfied it: the unused import line, nothing else
 *
 * Delete the real `registry.addInterceptor(…).addPathPatterns("/**")` line,
 * leave the import — which Java compiles happily as unused — and the gate still
 * printed "✓ interceptor + registration on admin, ucenter-api, otc-api,
 * exchange-api."
 *
 * The dual-book door is the boundary between the vendored exchange's own wallet
 * tables and the sovereign ledger, which makes it the most important guard in
 * the system, and it was being proved by an unused import line.
 *
 * `.addPathPatterns("/**")` is required rather than optional: an interceptor
 * registered against a narrower path set is a door with a gap, and the gap is
 * exactly where a money controller nobody remembered would sit.
 *
 * Comments are stripped first for the reason the kill-switch gate already
 * documents — a commented-out registration reads as a registration to a naive
 * matcher, and that is the same class of defect this fix is closing.
