/**
 * Map svc-ledger HTTP error bodies back to typed ledger errors.
 *
 * Production service clients used to `throw new Error(text)`, which dropped
 * `instanceof InsufficientFundsError` and broke fail-closed void paths (P2P-01).
 * s2s-http now emits structured `code` + amount fields when possible.
 *
 * THAT FIX WAS ONE CODE WIDE.
 *
 * `s2s-http.httpError` deliberately puts `code` on the wire for five distinct
 * cases and gives four of them their own status: `ledger.insufficient_funds`
 * (400), `ledger.owner_identity_space` (400), `ledger.unauthenticated` (401),
 * `ledger.frozen` (412), and any other `LedgerError` (500). This function
 * rebuilt exactly one of them, so every other code arrived at the caller as a
 * bare `Error` — no `code`, and `instanceof LedgerError` false.
 *
 * Five services call through here: svc-pay, svc-token, svc-agents, svc-trade,
 * svc-bank. What it cost them, in their own code:
 *
 *     rejection_code = ${err instanceof LedgerError ? err.code : 'bank.post_failed'}
 *       — svc-bank card-service.ts:589 and :734, loans/loan-service.ts:1601
 *
 * A card cashback or a loan disbursement refused because THE LEDGER WAS FROZEN
 * was written to the database, permanently, as `bank.post_failed`. The operator
 * reading rejection codes could not tell a deliberate platform halt from a post
 * that failed for an unknown reason — which is the same class of loss as a freeze
 * overwriting the previous freeze's reason (#1055): the reason a money movement
 * was refused, recorded wrongly. `svc-bank/router.ts:198` degrades the same way,
 * turning a 412 into a generic 500 for the end user.
 *
 * So: any structured `code` now rebuilds a `LedgerError` carrying it.
 *
 * `LedgerError` and not the specific subclass, on purpose. `InsufficientFundsError`
 * is rebuilt only when `requested` and `availableBalance` are actually on the
 * wire (fields or the message regex). Missing amounts are not `'0'`: empty is
 * not failed is not zero. `UnbalancedTransactionError` carries `perAsset`,
 * which is NOT on the wire, and `OwnerIdentitySpaceError` carries the owner
 * type and id, which are not either. Constructing those with invented or empty
 * fields would hand a caller a typed error whose data is fabricated — worse
 * than an honest base class, because it looks trustworthy. Callers branch on
 * `instanceof LedgerError` and on `.code`, and both of those are now true and
 * correct.
