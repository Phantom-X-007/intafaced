/**
 * FUTURES MARK POLICY — when a price is allowed to move money on a perp.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS IS NOT A NEW VOCABULARY. IT IS THE ONE FROM `prices.ts`, IN FUTURES.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `services/svc-bank/src/loans/prices.ts` already decided when a mark may move
 * someone's money, and `docs/adr/2026-08-04-bank-vertical-law.md` binds futures
 * to that decision. `docs/adr/2026-08-05-futures-risk-and-mark-law.md` is the
 * other half of the sentence: same `MarkQuality`, same four-field `MarkPolicy`,
 * same split `acceptableForMarking` / `acceptableForLiquidation` gates, same
 * meanings — with futures' own error codes in futures' own namespace.
 *
 * It is a MIRROR, not an import. svc-bank is another service and another
 * agent's; reaching into its source would be the cross-service coupling §2
 * forbids, and a shared package for four numbers and two predicates would be
 * worse than either. Where the two files disagree, `prices.ts` is the original
 * and this one is wrong.
 *
 * ── The three properties that carry across, each already argued once ─────────
 *
 * THE ASYMMETRY. Warnings tolerate a stale mark; seizures do not. `prices.ts`:
 * "Refusing to warn a borrower because the feed is 40 seconds old leaves them
 * uninformed; refusing to SELL on the same mark leaves them with their
 * collateral." On a perp: a margin-call notice may use a slightly stale mark, a
 * liquidation may not. Hence two staleness limits, not one.
 *
 * `last` IS NOT A LIQUIDATION BASIS. `liquidationQualities: ['index', 'mid']`.
 * One print moves `last`, and on a thin book that print is cheap to buy. A
 * market with no two-sided quote therefore cannot be liquidated at all — the
 * position sits and an operator looks at it. "An illiquid book is exactly where
 * a forced sale does most damage."
 *
 * A MISSING MARK IS NOT A ZERO MARK. There is no branch here that turns an
 * absent quote into `0`. The caller refuses to value rather than valuing at
 * nothing — and on a perp that matters more than on a loan, because valuing a
 * missing mark at zero does not under-collateralise one borrower, it liquidates
 * everyone at once.
 *
 * The deviation breaker is integer-only and rounds UP, so a move exactly on the
 * breaker trips it. No floats in this path, ever.
