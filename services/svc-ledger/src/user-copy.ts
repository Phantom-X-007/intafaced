/**
 * User-visible copy for `svc-ledger` posting / freeze / recipe refuse paths.

 * Every string a client reads from a refuse or status path goes through
 * `@intafaced/i18n`. Mode is `prod` on purpose: a missing key must not throw
 * on a live freeze refuse, and must not invent English — `tUnsafe` renders
 * the dotted key name, which is greppable and not blank.
 *
 * Catalog keys that already exist on tip are aliased from ledger error codes.
 * Codes with no catalog row stay the code itself until a catalog PR adds copy.
 * Balances and amounts are never invented here (decimal strings stay on the
 * structured error fields, not in copy).
