/**
 * THE CYCLE RUNNER'S ROUTE — an external cron reaches the charge cycle here.
 *
 * Its own module, and not four lines inline in `index.ts`, for one reason:
 * `reachability` is a doctrine gate, and a route defined inside the file that
 * also reads env, opens a pool, registers rails and calls `app.listen()` cannot
 * be reached by a test. This repository has produced *"six guards that were
 * correct in isolation and unreachable in place"*
 * (`adr/2026-08-08-twap-overdue-slice-disposition.md`, done bar item 6), and the
 * subscription engine's whole defence against double-charging is a guard. So the
 * route is registrable, and a test hits it over HTTP.
 *
 * `index.ts` registers exactly this — no second copy of the handler.
 *
 * S2S ONLY. An anonymous caller who found the port must not be able to fan out
 * invoices to every customer of every merchant on the platform, which is what an
 * unauthenticated due pass is.
 *
 * NOT a `setInterval`. Bank transplant law: a due runner that schedules itself
 * fires N times on N replicas.
