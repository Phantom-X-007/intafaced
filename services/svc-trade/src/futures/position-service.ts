/**
 * Futures position open/close + positionUpdated fan-out (trade.futures F3–F4).
 *
 * STATE in trade.positions; MARGIN only via ledger recipes (Doctrine §0.6).
 * Publishes `positionUpdated` so svc-ws private positions channel is not silent
 * after real opens.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * NO PRICE IN THIS FILE COMES FROM THE CALLER
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `docs/adr/2026-08-05-futures-risk-and-mark-law.md`: **a price that moves money
 * is never supplied by the party it pays.**
 *
 * `open()` used to take `entryPrice` and `close()` used to take `exitPrice`,
 * both straight off the request. Entry price sizes the margin lock; exit price
 * is the entire realised PnL. A caller who named their own exit price named
 * their own profit, and `futuresRealizeProfit` paid it out of a house pot. The
 * service was careful everywhere else — `funding-tick.ts` tells its own oracle
 * "implementations MUST NOT invent a placeholder rate" — but the guard was on
 * the source and not on the caller, and a rule that stops the engine inventing a
 * price while the API accepts one from whoever is being paid protects nothing.
 *
 * Both prices now come from the injected `MarkSource`, which reads the venue
 * fabric or the matching book. Neither is anything a request body can set, and
 * both arrive labelled so `mark-policy.ts` can refuse them.
 *
 * The refusal shape matters as much as the source: a request that carries a
 * price is REFUSED at the REST edge rather than silently re-priced, so a caller
 * learns instead of getting different behaviour than they asked for.

  /**
   * Close an open position at the CURRENT MARK — read from the mark port, never
   * supplied by the trader being paid.
   *
   * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   * WHY THIS IS A TRANSACTION AND NOT A SEQUENCE OF STATEMENTS
   * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * It used to be: `SELECT … status='open'` → read the mark → check the bound →
   * `ledger.post` × N → `UPDATE … status='closed'`. Every one of those steps was
   * correct on its own and the whole was a money drain, because there was no
   * lock, no transaction, and the idempotency key was minted per ATTEMPT:
   *
   *     closeId: `close:${row.id}:${randomUUID()}`
   *
   * `futuresRealizeProfit` keys on `futures.profit:${profitId}`, so a fresh UUID
   * per attempt meant the ledger had no way to recognise a duplicate and every
   * concurrent DELETE was a genuinely new payout. `futuresMarginRelease` keys on
   * `positionId:sequence`, so the margin release WAS deduped — which is why only
   * the profit multiplied, and why counting successful responses would have
   * shown nothing wrong.
   *
   * Eight concurrent closes of one position paid 5000 of honest PnL eight times.
   * The payout bound did not save it: each attempt read the pot's balance before
   * any of them had drained it, so the ceiling landed on the pot's whole balance
   * instead of on the honest PnL. That is the ADR's sentence failing again in a
   * new costume — *a price that moves money is never supplied by the party it
   * pays* — because the party being paid still chose the amount, this time
   * through N rather than through `exitPrice`.
   *
   * The window needs a yield between reading the row and writing it, and
   * production always has one: `markFor()` is an HTTP round trip.
   *
   * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   * TWO MECHANISMS, AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING
   * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * **`SELECT … FOR UPDATE` inside a transaction that spans the posts and the
   * status write.** Concurrent closes of one position serialise on the row: the
   * first commits, the rest are released, re-read the row they were waiting on,
   * find it `closed` and refuse — before they post anything. This works across
   * replicas, which an in-process mutex would not, and the lock is on ONE row so
   * closes of other positions are unaffected.
   *
   * **An idempotency key derived from the position, not from the attempt.**
   * `closeId` is now `close:${row.id}` — stable. A lock only orders attempts
   * that overlap in time, and the sequential form of this bug does not: put the
   * row back to `open` by a replay, a restore or an operator's UPDATE and a
   * second close races nothing at all. The stable key is what stops that one,
   * and it is also what covers the gap the transaction cannot close by itself —
   * the ledger is a different system, so a commit that fails after the posts
   * succeeded leaves the row open with the money already moved, and the retry
   * must not pay again. It does not: the ledger returns the original
   * transaction.
   *
   * Neither mechanism subsumes the other, so reverting either one is caught by
   * `position-close-concurrency.test.ts`.
   *
   * Nothing posts until every refusal has been cleared, and a refusal rolls the
   * transaction back: a close that is going to be refused leaves the books and
   * the row exactly as it found them.
