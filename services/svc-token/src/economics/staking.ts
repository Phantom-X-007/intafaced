/**
 * Staking — lock tiers, stake weight, access gates, fee discounts.
 *
 * §4.3 stakes: `(id, user_id, amount, tier enum[flex,m3,m12], multiplier, started_at,
 * unlocks_at, status)`. This module is the arithmetic behind those columns — the row is
 * written by the service, the numbers in it come from here.
 *
 * Every multiplier and discount is basis points (10000 = 1.0x). A multiplier is a rate
 * applied to money, and a rate stored as a float is a rate that disagrees with itself
 * across two machines. There is no float anywhere in this file.
 *
 * Two consumers, §4.3: other services call `token.stakeOf(userId)` to "gate launchpad
 * allocations, OTC access, premium lobbies, vendor slots" (`accessTierFor`), and the
 * `feeCharge` recipe checks the "published decay schedule" (`feeDiscountBps`).
 *
 * The access ladder is code; the fee-discount ladder is NOT. §4.3 puts the latter in
 * `token_params.fee_discount_schedule` and hands parameter control to governance, so this
 * file only seeds and validates it — see `DEFAULT_FEE_DISCOUNT_SCHEDULE`.
