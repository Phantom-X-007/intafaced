/**
 * THE PARTIAL-LIQUIDATION LADDER FOR ISOLATED PERPS.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT WAS MISSING, AND WHY IT MATTERED
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The tracker row `trade.futures` reads "Perps: isolated margin, funding,
 * partial-liquidation ladder". Two of those three were built. The third was not:
 * `liquidation-planner.ts` closes the WHOLE position on every trigger, and
 * `liquidation-tick.ts` said so out loud in its own header — "Out of scope: mark
 * oracle product, matching engine, partial ladder, funding."
 *
 * `DIRECTION-2026-07-31.md` §1 does not treat that as a smaller version of the
 * same thing:
 *
 *   · "**Partial liquidation before full close.** Close the minimum that
 *     restores maintenance margin. Full close is a failure mode, not a policy."
 *   · "**Maintenance margin laddered by position size.** A position large
 *     relative to book depth is riskier at the same notional; the ladder must
 *     reference actual depth, not a constant."
 *
 * `docs/adr/2026-08-05-futures-risk-and-mark-law.md` then says futures adopts
 * the shape already argued in `services/svc-bank/src/loans/risk.ts` — closed-form
 * tranche sizing, `maxTrancheBps`, and a target that a liquidation restores TO
 * rather than stopping AT. This file is that adoption, in perp terms.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE ONE PIECE OF PERP ALGEBRA THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On a loan, selling collateral RAISES the borrower's health because it retires
 * debt. On an isolated perp it does not, and a design that assumes it does will
 * loop forever closing tranches that change nothing.
 *
 * Write margin `m`, size `S`, unrealised PnL `u` (negative in trouble). Equity is
 * `m + u`. Close a fraction `f` at the mark: the tranche realises `f·u`, which
 * leaves the margin pot, so `m' = m + f·u`; the remainder still carries
 * `u' = (1−f)·u`. Then
 *
 *     equity' = m' + u' = (m + f·u) + (1−f)·u = m + u = equity.
 *
 * **Equity is invariant under a close at the mark.** Closing does not make a
 * trader richer or poorer — that is what "at the mark" means. What it changes is
 * the REQUIREMENT, because maintenance margin is a fraction of notional and
 * notional is what just shrank:
 *
 *     required' = mmBps · (1−f)·S·M / 10 000.
 *
 * So a partial liquidation restores the ratio by lowering the denominator, never
 * by raising the numerator. Two consequences are load-bearing below:
 *
 *   1. **A partial rung releases NO margin to the trader.** The margin left in
 *      the pot after the realised loss is what backs the remainder. Releasing it
 *      pro-rata would hold `equity` constant while cutting `m`, which is exactly
 *      the un-collateralised remainder this whole file exists to prevent. Only a
 *      rung that closes the position releases residual margin.
 *   2. **If equity is already ≤ 0, no `f` helps.** `required' ≥ 0` for every `f`,
 *      and a non-positive equity meets no requirement at any size. That is
 *      bankruptcy, it is a full close, and the shortfall is the insurance fund's
 *      — the arithmetic says so rather than a special case asserting it.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHICH WAY EACH FIGURE ROUNDS, AND WHO PAYS FOR IT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Lifted deliberately from `loans/risk.ts`, because the argument is the same one
 * and a second, differently-rounded copy of it would be a defect:
 *
 *   · RISK figures round AGAINST the platform's optimism. Notional rounds UP,
 *     the maintenance requirement rounds UP, the unrealised loss used to DECIDE
 *     rounds AWAY from zero, the health ratio rounds DOWN. A book that
 *     under-reports risk by one unit learns about a bad position one tick late,
 *     and one tick late is the whole cost of the event.
 *
 *   · CHARGES to the trader round DOWN. The realised loss actually POSTED on a
 *     tranche rounds toward zero, in the trader's favour. The platform forgoing a
 *     sub-attounit is not a business risk; systematically taking one from a
 *     leveraged trader is the kind of thing only the trader ever discovers.
 *
 * The same `u` is therefore computed twice with opposite rounding, and that is
 * not an oversight — `riskPnl` decides whether to act, `chargedPnl` decides what
 * is debited. They differ by at most one attounit and they differ on purpose.
 *
 * NO FLOATS ANYWHERE. Every ratio is integer basis points, every value is a
 * scaled bigint, and every division states its rounding. A maintenance ratio in
 * floating point is a wrong liquidation, not an imprecise one, because the
 * comparison that flips is at the boundary and the boundary is where every
 * liquidation happens.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS FILE STILL DOES NOT DO
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * · It does not deliver a margin call, and therefore it does not run a grace
 *   clock. The ADR is explicit that "a margin call that cannot be delivered is
 *   not a margin call" and that grace must not start without a transport. There
 *   is no production margin-call transport in `svc-trade` today, so this file
 *   reports the `margin-call` rung and stops there rather than shipping a grace
 *   timer that would silently authorise seizures off an undelivered notice.
 *   Delivery is a SEPARATE port (`notifyMarginCall` on the liquidation tick);
 *   the pure seals below (`mayStartMarginCallGrace` /
 *   `mayLiquidateFromExpiredMarginCallGrace`) are the only lawful way a future
 *   grace field may start or expire into seizure. Grace *duration* numbers are
 *   DIRECTION §8 / D3 owner-reserved — never invent them here.
 * · It does not choose the numbers. Every value in `DEFAULT_FUTURES_LADDER_POLICY`
 *   is a placeholder for a `DIRECTION` §8 item 8 ruling — "any leverage or margin
 *   parameter beyond §1's stated defaults" is the owner's. The MECHANISM is
 *   agent-implementable per the ADR; the tier table is not, so it lives in one
 *   named constant with somewhere for the owner's answer to land.
 * · It adds no ledger recipe. Partial rungs post through `futuresRealizeLoss` and
 *   `futuresMarginRelease`, which already exist. Adding a recipe is a
 *   `DIRECTION` §3 carve-out reserved to the owner.

 * THE LARGEST SIZE THE TRADER MAY KEEP AND STILL MEET THE TARGET.
 *
 * `DIRECTION` §1 says "close the MINIMUM that restores maintenance margin", and
 * this is where that word is earned. Getting it wrong in the safe-looking
 * direction still costs the trader real money: an over-sized rung sells a
 * position that did not need selling, and there is no posting that gives it back.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT ONE DIVISION ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Within a single maintenance tier the condition is linear. Keep `k`, and since
 * equity does not move (see the header) the whole constraint is on the
 * requirement:
 *
 *     equity ≥ targetBps/10⁴ · mmBps/10⁴ · k·M/SCALE
 *  ⇔  k ≤ equity · 10⁸ · SCALE / (targetBps · mmBps · M)
 *
 * The FIRST version of this function stopped there, solving once against the
 * position's CURRENT tier and calling the extra closure conservative. A property
 * test caught it: `mmBps` is a function of `k`, because the tier is keyed on the
 * position's notional relative to depth and closing shrinks that notional. Solve
 * against the pre-close tier and a rung that drops the position into a CHEAPER
 * tier over-closes — on the counterexample the property found, by about 0.2% of
 * the position, silently and every time.
 *
 * ── THE SEARCH, AND WHY IT IS EXACT ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The requirement is NON-DECREASING in `k`, all the way across the tier table:
 * notional rises with `k`, `maintenanceBpsFor` never falls as notional rises
 * (`assertLadderPolicyCoherent` refuses a table where it could), and `mulBps`
 * rises with both. So feasibility is monotone, the feasible set is a prefix
 * `[0, k*]`, and one bisection finds `k*` exactly.
 *
 * BISECTING RATHER THAN SOLVING, even though the algebra is right there, and the
 * reason is the two `ceil`s. `mul(k, M, 'ceil')` and `mulBps(notional, mm, 'ceil')`
 * each round the requirement up by up to one attounit, so the algebraic answer
 * sits one or two units above the largest `k` that actually passes the integer
 * check. Reaching for the equation and then fudging the last two units is how a
 * rounding bug gets written. `feasible` below is the SAME arithmetic
 * `planLadderRung` uses to decide the position is in trouble in the first place,
 * so the sizing and the trigger can never disagree about what the requirement is.
 *
 * About sixty iterations, once per liquidatable position per tick. Not on any hot
 * path, and nowhere near the cost of the ledger post it precedes.
