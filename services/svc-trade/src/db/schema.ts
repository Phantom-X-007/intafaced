 * THE PRODUCT LAYER (§5.2).
 *
 * What is listed, what was ordered, what was matched. THIS SERVICE'S SCHEMA
 * ONLY — svc-matching owns the book, svc-ledger owns the balances, and neither
 * is reachable from here except through its API.
 *
 * Doctrine §0.6 is the rule that shapes every column below: **this service
 * holds no balances.** `orders.filled_qty` is order state measured in the base
 * asset, not money. `orders.hold_amount` is an immutable record of the ledger
 * post that funded the order — it is written once and never mutated, in the
 * same spirit as `token.stakes.amount`. There is deliberately no
 * `released_amount`, no `available`, and no running total anywhere: the
 * remainder owed back to a user is *derived* (`hold_amount - Σ fills`), so
 * there is nothing here that could drift away from the ledger.
 *
 * Scope of this migration is `trade.spot`. §5.2 also specifies `positions`,
 * `funding_rates`, `insurance_fund`, `copy_leaders`, `copy_follows` and
 * `otc_quotes` — those belong to `trade.futures`, `trade.copy` and `trade.otc`,
 * which are separate tracker features with their own PRs. The `kind` enum
 * already carries their values so listing a futures market later is a row, not
 * a migration.
