/**
 * SUITES THAT STILL SKIP WITHOUT SAYING SO — the register of what is NOT fixed.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN AN `// eslint-disable`-SHAPED EXEMPTION
 *
 * The change that added `postgresAvailable` journalling and
 * `tooling/ci/skip-honesty-scan.mjs` could not reach every offender. Each entry
 * below carries the specific reason it was left and what would lift it.
 *
 * PRIVATE_PROBE is empty. The last money private probe
 * (`svc-pay/src/rails/evm-chain.live.test.ts`) now journals via `recordInfraProbe`.
 * Lifting it from this list is the debt being paid, not a silent exemption:
 * skip-honesty will fail a new private probe on that path the same as anywhere else.
 *
 * svc-protocol's UNJOURNALLED lock below is NOT a phantom. `/services/svc-protocol/`
 * is a real CODEOWNERS line (@shehzad002) and the chain plane is his to implement,
 * so that hold names its scope, sits where merges pass, and states who lifts it.
 *
 * So the register is loud in both directions:
 *
 *   · `skip-honesty-scan.mjs` does not fail on these, but the list CANNOT GROW —
 *     a new private probe anywhere else is still red.
 *   · It also cannot GO STALE. If an entry stops violating, the scan fails and
 *     tells you to delete the entry. An exemption outlives its reason by default;
 *     this one has to be removed on purpose.
 *   · `infra-verdict.mjs` refuses to say COMPLETE while any entry stands. The
 *     strongest sentence it can print becomes "complete except for the suites
 *     below, which cannot report either way" — which is the true one.
 *
 * Every entry is a debt with a named owner, not a decision.

 * Test files that decide whether to run using a connection they opened
