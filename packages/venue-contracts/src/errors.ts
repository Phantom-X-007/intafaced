/**
 * WHY A VENUE COULD NOT BE USED — the vocabulary every response reports in.
 *
 * §27's honesty requirement is not "handle errors". It is that a venue which is
 * down, stale, or rate-limited must be **excluded and reported**, never quietly
 * substituted by another. A caller that receives a price with no idea that four
 * of five venues dropped out has been told something false by omission.
 *
 * So every exclusion is typed, and the reasons are deliberately NOT collapsed:
 *
 *   · `unreachable` — the venue did not answer.
 *   · `stale` — the venue answered with data too old to price against.
 *   · `rate_limited` — WE stopped asking, to avoid a ban.
 *   · `desynced` — a sequence gap; the book we hold is no longer the venue's.
 *
 * Those demand four different responses from whoever is on call, and merging
 * any two of them hides the one incident that matters. "The indexer is down"
 * and "the indexer is up and forty seconds behind" look identical in a metric
 * that only counts failures.

 *
 * ── Why this is loud rather than a plausible rejection ──────────────────────
 *
 * The tempting alternative is to return `{ status: 'rejected' }`, which type-
 * checks and lets a caller proceed. It is the worst option available: an
 * execution port that answers plausibly while doing nothing reports fills that
 * never happened, and a router that "tried" a venue and got a rejection will
 * happily route the rest of the order elsewhere and call the result a fill.
 *
 * A missing key is not a market condition. It is a deployment that is not
 * finished, and it must read like one.
