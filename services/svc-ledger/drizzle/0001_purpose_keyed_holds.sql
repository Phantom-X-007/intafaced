-- svc-ledger · P0-3 purpose-keyed holds
-- Reversal: 0001_purpose_keyed_holds.down.sql
--
-- An account's identity gains a fifth component. Before this, `hold` was one
-- bucket per (user, asset): an order reservation and an in-flight withdrawal
-- shared a balance, so `withdraw.settle` could draw down value an open order
-- was relying on. Both entries balance, the hash chain verifies, reconciliation
-- passes — and the order is silently unfunded, with nothing in the book able to
-- say which hold was consumed, because no such distinction was ever recorded.

-- NOT NULL DEFAULT '' rather than a nullable column, deliberately.
--
-- In a standard UNIQUE index Postgres treats NULLs as DISTINCT, so a nullable
-- `purpose` would let ('user','u1','BTC','hold',NULL) be inserted twice and the
-- constraint would raise nothing. The commingled bucket would come back as
-- duplicate rows instead of one shared row — strictly worse, because the
-- balance would then be split across accounts that look identical.
--
-- '' is the honest normal form for "this account kind has no sub-identity".
ALTER TABLE "ledger"."accounts"
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "purpose" text NOT NULL DEFAULT '';

-- BACKFILL — and an honest admission about what cannot be backfilled.
--
-- An existing `hold` row has a balance whose purpose is genuinely unknowable:
-- not recording it is precisely the bug being fixed, so there is nothing to
-- recover it from. Guessing would be worse than admitting it.
--
-- Each pre-existing hold therefore becomes its OWN purpose keyed on its account
-- id. That preserves every balance exactly, merges nothing, and keeps the rows
-- distinct — while labelling them so nobody mistakes them for attributed value.
--
-- OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCE, stated rather than buried: a `legacy:` hold cannot
-- be released by `orderHoldRelease` or `withdrawSettle`, because those look for
-- `order:<id>` / `withdraw:<id>`. Any that exist must be resolved by hand
-- against the module that placed them. At the time of writing nothing is
-- deployed, so in every real environment this UPDATE matches zero rows.

-- Only `hold` requires a purpose. `escrow`, `stake` and `collateral` are keyed
-- by their own business object elsewhere, and an `available` balance is
-- fungible with itself — giving it a purpose would fragment it for nothing.

-- database is the last thing standing between a bug and a book that cannot say
-- whose money moved.
