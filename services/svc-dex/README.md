# svc-dex — the Protocol Plane's front door (§8.6, §17.5)

> §17.5: _"`svc-dex` is absorbed into this plane — the DEX is not a module beside the exchange; it IS the Protocol Plane's front door."_

Permissionless by construction, non-custodial by proof.

## Why there is no KYC here

§503, and it is worth quoting exactly because it is the difference between this and evasion:

> _"Sovereignty by architecture, not evasion. No-KYC exists on the Protocol Plane because there is nothing to KYC — the platform never holds user assets there. Reference proof: Hyperliquid's entire model."_

This is not a relaxed version of the custodial venue. It is a different custody posture, and the absence of an identity gate follows from it rather than being granted.

Three mechanisms make that structural rather than aspirational:

1. **`custody-scan` covers this service.** It fails the build if svc-dex imports `ledger.post` or any write recipe. Doctrine §16.10: _"Provably non-custodial or it doesn't merge."_
2. **No `INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET` in its environment.** That secret is what lets a service reach `ledger.post`. Without it, an import that slipped past the scanner still could not move value.
3. **No `DATABASE_URL`.** A database here would eventually hold a position, and a position we hold is custody.

| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `health`       | public                                          | liveness; names `internalBook.custodial: true` when that venue is on (not a non-custodial AMM) |
| `quote`        | `publicJurisdictionProcedure('dex','protocol')` | **live** ranked quotes across sourced venues (not certified best execution)                    |
| `routePreview` | `publicJurisdictionProcedure('dex','protocol')` | routing arithmetic over caller-supplied quotes                                                 |

> `routePreview` **is not a price and must never be rendered as one.** It answers "given these venue quotes, where would the order go?" — useful for a routing explainer or a simulation, and useless as a quote, because the inputs came from whoever called it. It was previously called `quote`, which is precisely how a caller ends up displaying invented numbers in good faith.

`quote` still runs the jurisdiction matrix. **A sanctioned region is a legal constraint, not a custody one** — `checkAccess` short-circuits a `custodial: false` protocol-plane module to `allowed.permissionless` before any tier is read, so the gate that remains is the one that must, and the one that must not is gone.

Compare `svc-trade`, the custodial venue: `scopedProcedure('trade:write')` with `minTier: 'basic'`. Same platform, two planes, and the difference is one line in each router.

## The smart order router

§8.6: _"internal book vs. pool quote → best execution."_

Two venues quoting the same headline price are usually not equivalent. An AMM quote already includes its price impact but pays gas; a book quote is exact at the top and worse as depth is consumed. **Comparing headline prices picks the wrong venue routinely**, so this compares _effective price_ — what the taker actually ends up with after fees and settlement cost.

Fees apply to the side that pays them: a buyer receives less base, raising cost per unit; a seller receives less quote, lowering proceeds per unit. Settlement cost is added on a buy and subtracted on a sell — it is a cost to the taker in both directions and must never look like income.

Routing is greedy over per-venue quotes. **Not provably optimal** — a true optimum needs a depth curve per venue, not a single quote. Ties break on venue id so routing is a function of the quote _set_, not of arrival order: two identical requests must route identically, or a fill becomes unreproducible and no dispute about it can be settled.

## Where prices come from

`quote` used to take `quotes: []` over the wire and route whatever the caller supplied. The arithmetic was real; the prices came from nowhere. **A fabricated price in a trading product is worse than an outage**, because an outage stops a user and an invented number encourages one.

A price now enters this service by exactly one road: a `QuoteVenue`, which has to have really fetched a book from something, and has to say when. `QuoteVenue` **extends `LiquiditySource`** from `packages/venue-adapter` — the §27 venue fabric, our own CCXT-class layer — adding only the two things the Fiat Plane router does not model: `settlementCost` (gas) and `depth()` (the book _with_ the moment we read it).

| Venue               | `kind`              | Plane      | Source                  | Status today                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `intachain-clob`    | `external-dex`      | `protocol` | svc-indexer read models | **refuses** — nothing projected (SOCKET §13 `socket.evm-rpc`) |
| `internal-book`     | `internal`          | `fiat`     | svc-matching depth      | live wherever the engine has the market                       |
| operator-configured | `external-cex` etc. | `external` | public depth endpoints  | live once `DEX_EXTERNAL_VENUES` has a row                     |

**No venue is named in shipped code** (Doctrine §0.4 adapters-not-integrations, §0.7 no vendor names). Adding one is a row of `DEX_EXTERNAL_VENUES` config, and the default set is empty — a service with no outbound egress does not silently acquire it.

There is **no `ccxt` dependency and must never be one.** §27 forbids a third-party connectivity library in the money path, and CCXT's unified `fetchOrderBook` returns JavaScript **numbers** — routing through it would put a float in front of every price in the platform. Every adapter reads the venue's own decimal strings and refuses a JSON number outright.

The internal book implements the same interface as everyone else, so **the router has no notion of "ours" versus "theirs" and cannot quietly favour us.** It ranks on effective price alone; there is no internal-preference thumb on the scale anywhere in this service's path.

### Refusal, never a guess

`QUOTE_MAX_AGE_MS` (2000ms default) is enforced once, at assembly, against the moment _this process_ finished reading each venue — not a timestamp the venue supplied. Books are aged against a single clock reading taken after every fetch lands, so a venue answering in 20ms and one answering in 1900ms are not compared as though simultaneous. A book dated in the **future** is refused too: a negative age is a broken clock, not freshness.

There is no cache, no last-known value and no fallback venue. Every exit is a route built from fresh books, or a refusal carrying a machine-readable code:

| Code                            | HTTP                  | Meaning                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dex.quote.no_venue_configured` | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | nothing wired — an operator problem                         |
| `dex.quote.no_venue_available`  | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | no venue answered; the market may be fine, we cannot see it |
| `dex.quote.stale`               | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | answered, but past the freshness ceiling                    |
| `dex.quote.no_liquidity`        | `NOT_FOUND`           | fresh books, nothing resting on the side asked for          |

### "Best of N" must not mean "the only one that answered"

A cross-venue router degrades quietly by nature: three venues configured, two time out, and the survivor is presented as the best of three. So the response states it — `venuesConfigured` is how many were asked, `venues` is who priced, `unavailable` is who did not **and why**, `degraded` is true when those disagree, and `singleVenue` is true when exactly one survived out of more than one. Ranking honesty is not a certified best-execution claim: `bestEx.claimed` is false until owner law is set.

Every venue also carries `plane` and `custodial`, derived from `kind` rather than configured. A permissionless caller may be quoted our internal book — it sometimes genuinely has the better price — but a fill there settles through the ledger, which is not self-custody. Disclosing that is the difference between an honest quote and a price behind a gate the user was told did not exist.

### Execution is refused, loudly

Every adapter declares `capabilities: ['quote', 'orderbook']` and **throws** on `submit` — not a no-op, not a plausible `status: 'rejected'`. Cross-venue execution is §28 (`svc-execution`, not built) and external venues need trade-scoped Venue Vault credentials (§27) that have not been issued. An execution port that answered plausibly while doing nothing would report fills that never happened.

## Events

**None.** This service publishes and consumes nothing.

## Ledger recipes used

**None, and that is enforced.** See `custody-scan`. If this section ever lists a recipe, the DEX has stopped being a DEX.

## Kill-switch

`dex.routing` in `FLAG_REGISTRY`.

## Not built yet

- **The on-chain leg is opt-in and still does not answer.** `intachain-clob` is attached only when both CLOB fee knobs are set (S-I3). Once attached it refuses with `not_ready` until svc-indexer has projected chain state (SOCKET §13 `socket.evm-rpc`). That refusal _is_ the correct behaviour — the DEX cannot quote the sovereign plane until a chain exists to quote.
- **No AMM venue.** `svc-protocol` now ships a constant-product AMM (`protocol.amm`), but `quoteExactIn` takes **reserves as input** — it is arithmetic, the same shape of gap `quote` just closed. Nothing projects pool reserves: svc-indexer models books, fills and positions, not pools, and there is no EVM RPC to read `getReserves` from. Wiring an AMM venue therefore needs a reserve source first; inventing reserves to make a pool appear in a quote would recreate exactly the defect this PR removed.
- **Order submission.** Routing decides _where_; executing against a pool is a contract call from the user's own smart account, which belongs with `svc-protocol` and needs the contract toolchain socket closed first. Every adapter here refuses `submit`.
- **No rate-limit governor.** §27 asks for one per venue. This adapter fetches on every quote, so a busy market will hit a public endpoint hard enough to be throttled. A venue answering 429 degrades to `unreachable` and is dropped from routing rather than serving a bad price — correct, but a degradation, not a governor.
- **REST polling, not WS streaming.** §27 asks for WS-first, sequenced, gap-detected books. `packages/market-data` already has the sequence machinery; wiring it needs a stream.
- **Latency is graded but not weighted.** `health()` records round-trip per venue and every quote discloses it, so the input exists; nothing consumes it as a routing weight yet.
- **Projection lag is not measured.** `observedAt` catches a slow _read_, not a projection that is up, unhalted and twenty blocks behind the chain. Closing that needs one extra field on svc-indexer's status output.
- **Depth-curve routing.** See above — greedy is deliberate and documented, not accidental.
- **CLOB fees have no silent zero.** SOCKET `socket.dex-fee-source` (S-I3). `DEX_CLOB_FEE_BPS` and `DEX_CLOB_SETTLEMENT_COST` must be set together from the venue, or omitted together — omitted means `intachain-clob` is not quoted. A default of 0 understates the user's cost. Internal-book bps have no default: blank + enabled refuses `dex.internal_book_fee_unset` (never invent 20). The internal book is custodial; every response still discloses `custodial`, `feeBps` and `settlementCost` per venue.
