/**
 * THE EMPTY-DENOMINATOR LAW — a gate about gates.
 *
 * WHAT IT ENFORCES
 * ────────────────
 * A scan that walks nothing must REFUSE, not report clean. `✓ 0 problems` over
 * an empty file list is not evidence of health; it is the absence of evidence
 * wearing a tick.
 *
 * This is the repo's single most repeated defect. It has landed as a scan
 * walking zero files and printing clean; a dashboard querying a metric nobody
 * emitted; a gate registered and never run (`i18n-scan.mjs`, weeks, which is
 * why `gates.mjs` grew its manifest check); a test double omitting the field
 * production omits; and a latency grader returning a confident `'F'` for an
 * adapter no caller had ever invoked — a measured verdict on an unmeasured
 * thing, with the test asserting the verdict as intended.
 *
 * Seven gates had each learned it separately and independently hand-rolled a
 * guard: `brand-scan` (`scanned === 0`), `i18n-scan`, `i18n-bypass-scan`
 * ("walked zero un-allowlisted files and printed"), `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan`
 * ("every denominator non-zero"), `event-wiring`, `shell-brand-scan`,
 * `vendor-java-money-scan`. Seven implementations of one rule, and NOTHING
 * enforcing it — so the eighth gate anyone wrote would not have it, because
 * nothing would ask.
 *
 * HOW IT PROVES IT — executed, not inspected
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Grepping for `scanned === 0` proves a string exists in a file. It does not
 * prove a gate refuses. So this gate RUNS every other gate against a tree
 * where its denominator is genuinely zero, and asserts what it actually did:
 *
 *   · a fixture tree is built containing ONLY a copy of `tooling/` — enough for
 *     a gate script and its sibling imports to load — plus an empty directory.
 *   · every gate is spawned from that copy with `cwd` set to the EMPTY dir.
 *     That zeroes both rooting styles at once, and they need different things:
 *     ~21 gates root at `process.cwd()`, so an empty cwd empties their subject;
 *     the rest root at `import.meta.url`, so only running the copy does.
 *     (Measured: run with `cwd` at the fixture root instead, `brand-scan`
 *     reports "clean — 76 files" because `tooling/` is itself in its scope. The
 *     empty cwd is what makes its denominator actually zero. `shell-brand` is
 *     the one gate that needs the other cwd — it reads `brand-scan.mjs`
 *     relative to ROOT to avoid restating the forbidden names, so under a bare
 *     cwd it dies on that read instead of reaching its own guard. Its row says
 *     `tree: 'tooling-only'` for exactly that reason.)
 *   · ENFORCED gates must exit non-zero AND match a pinned refusal, so a gate
 *     that loses its guard but still throws for some other reason is red too.
 *   · EXEMPT gates must exit ZERO in that same empty tree. That is the executed
 *     proof of the exemption itself: a gate whose subject travels with it in
 *     fixtures does not care that the repo is gone, and one that secretly
 *     depended on the repo would fail here and be exposed as misclassified.
 *   · BLIND gates are frozen debt — measured, named, printing clean over
 *     nothing today. Each row pins the exact clean line it emits, so FIXING one
 *     turns this gate red until its row is deleted. The list can only shrink.
 *
 * WHY THE CLASSIFICATION IS THE MECHANISM
 * ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Every entry in `GATES` must appear in exactly one of the four tables below.
 * An unclassified gate is a hard failure with no default — the same ratchet
 * shape `fabricated-money-scan`, `vendor-java-money-scan`,
 * `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan` and `test-typecheck` already use here. A new gate
 * cannot be silently skipped: it must be classified, and classifying it means
 * running it against nothing and looking at what it did. That is the whole
 * point. A meta-gate that quietly ignored gates it did not recognise would be
 * the very defect it polices.
 *
 * WHICH BRINGS US TO THE IRONY PROBLEM
 * ────────────────────────────────────
 * A gate about empty denominators is the most obvious candidate in this repo to
 * BE one. A version of this file that discovered zero gates and printed
 * `✓ all classified` would be perfect irony and worse than nothing, because it
 * would read as coverage. Three things stop that, all of them checks rather
 * than intentions:
 *
 *   1. the classified census is asserted against `GATES.length` from the real
 *      array — imported, not parsed out of source text — and against zero. A
 *      discovery bug cannot pass as an empty run.
 *   2. `selfProof()` runs on EVERY invocation, never behind a flag nobody
 *      types. It re-spawns this file against a substitute gate list — one with
 *      `GATES = []`, one with a single unclassified gate — and requires both to
 *      be refused. This is the `RULE_PROBES` precedent in
 *      `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan`, and the `worktree-gc --self-test` precedent
 *      that became gate 28 because nothing ran it.
 *   3. this gate classifies ITSELF, as `SELF`. It cannot run in its own
 *      fixture — it would recurse — so `selfProof` is the executed stand-in,
 *      and that substitution is stated rather than hidden.
 *
 * HONEST LIMIT, stated because the alternative is implying coverage
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Five ENFORCED gates refuse by UNCAUGHT throw, not by a guard: `secrets`,
 * `lang-duplicate-key`, `dual-book-door-paths`, `compose-secret-parity`,
 * `money-property-mutation`. A stack trace is a refusal — nobody reads
 * `ENOENT` as a clean bill of health — so they satisfy the law. But it is
 * WEAKER, and in a specific way worth naming: it proves the gate refuses when
 * its subject is MISSING, not when its subject exists and is EMPTY. Those rows
 * are marked `kind: 'uncaught'` and counted separately in the summary, so the
 * number is visible instead of blended into the strong ones.
 *
 * This gate polices GATES ONLY. Product code — where the latency grader lived —
 * is a much larger surface and needs a different mechanism. Not attempted here;
 * recorded as a residual.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tooling/ci/empty-denominator-gate.mjs           run it
 *   node tooling/ci/empty-denominator-gate.mjs --verbose print every verdict
