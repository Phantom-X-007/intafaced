/**
 * DOCTRINE GATES — one list, run by `pnpm verify` AND by CI.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * ────────────────────
 * `AGENTS.md` and its sibling agent entry file both tell every human and every
 * agent the same thing: run `pnpm verify` before you claim done. That promise
 * is only worth something if `verify` runs what CI runs. Until this file it did
 * not, and the two lists lived in two places that knew nothing about each other:
 *
 *   · the `verify` script in package.json, and
 *   · the eleven hand-written steps in the `gates` job of ci.yml.
 *
 * Two gates had already drifted out of the local list — `scan:dual-book-door-paths`
 * and `scan:test-db` — so an engineer could run `pnpm verify` green, push, and
 * land red on a gate they had no local way of running. That is the exact failure
 * this file removes: CI and verify now consume the SAME array, so a gate cannot
 * be in one and missing from the other.
 *
 * It also removes a duplication. Six of these scans used to run twice per CI
 * run — once in the `gates` job and again inside `dod-gate.mjs` in the `dod`
 * job. `dod-gate.mjs` is now what its name says: the per-service §14 Definition
 * of Done. The repo-wide scans live here.
 *
 * THE THIRD DRIFT, and the one that actually bit
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `i18n-scan.mjs` sat in `tooling/ci/` for weeks wired into nothing at all —
 * not verify, not CI. Nobody deleted it and nobody ran it. So this runner
 * asserts that EVERY `.mjs` in `tooling/ci/` is either in `GATES` below or in
 * `NOT_GATES` with a written reason. A new scan cannot be added and quietly
 * never run: the manifest check fails until someone says which it is.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tooling/ci/gates.mjs          run every gate, report all failures
 *   node tooling/ci/gates.mjs --list   print the gate ids, one per line

/**
 * The gates. Ordered cheapest-and-most-structural first, so the fastest
 * feedback is the feedback you get first.
 *
 * `advisory: true` means the scan runs and prints but cannot fail the build —
 * used only where the scan is a reporter by design. It is NOT a way to silence
 * a gate that fails; see i18n below for the one case and why.

      'is the shape of the six guards this repo has already built correct and left unreachable. Cheap enough to sit ' +

      'status, so an offline laptop or a credential expiry printed `· fetching main` and cut from whatever the last ' +
      'successful fetch left behind. Neither showed on stdout: it printed the path and nothing about the base, so a ' +
      'worktree cut 38 commits stale looked identical to a fresh one and was found by hand (2026-08-09) rather than by ' +
      'a check. The cost is not theoretical — a branch abandoned the same day was 182 commits behind with 1,303 ' +
      'insertions and 812 passing tests, because rebasing a money-path branch that far is how a subtle regression ' +
      'lands with a green diff. The fix pins the start point to a 40-char object id once, after the fetch, and reports ' +
      'it. These fixtures hold that: pass a ref name to the add again, resolve the ref twice, drop the fetch-status ' +
      'check, drop the ancestry warning, or flatten the branch-name convention, and a named case goes red. Four of ' +
      'them read this file’s own text above the self-test marker, because a revert can leave both pure functions ' +
      'correct and re-resolve the ref at the call site instead. Pure fixtures — no git, no network, no disk — so it ' +

(ci.yml writes that exclusion as negated `paths:` rather than `paths-ignore`, because INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md is law and coverage-check has to see it; the set of excluded docs is unchanged.)

NOT a gate, on purpose: it cannot distinguish a dead claim from one whose owner is thirty seconds from writing it back, and reddening main on that guess would block the sessions it protects — a guard that stops work when it is wrong is worse than no guard.

Wiring it there would either make the fast pre-flight slow or make it wrong. So `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm verify` and CI all run it, in parallel and turbo-cached (the script is a globalDependency, so editing the pinned list busts that cache). It is a ratchet in the same shape as fabricated-money-scan: 70 pre-existing test type errors frozen by exact text AND count, a new one is red, and a FIXED one is red too until its row is deleted — so the list can only shrink.
