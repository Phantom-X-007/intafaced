/**
 * MARKS — where a wrong number becomes someone else's liquidation.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT §8.1 ASKS FOR AND WHAT ACTUALLY EXISTS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §8.1: "portfolio-aware LTV job (marks from svc-trade index prices)".
 *
 * svc-trade has no index price. It has `GET /api/v1/ticker/:symbol`, which
 * returns best bid, best ask and LAST TRADE from svc-matching's in-memory book,
 * and `GET /api/v1/tickers` for all markets. There is no TWAP, no external
 * oracle, no multi-venue median, and nothing that survives one trade on a thin
 * book. That is not a criticism of svc-trade — it is a market-data surface doing
 * its job — but it means the sentence in the spec describes a component that has
 * not been built, and a loan book that marks off `last` inherits every property
 * of `last`.
 *
 * The attack is not hypothetical and it is cheap. A borrower's collateral is
 * marked at the last trade. On a market with little resting depth, the borrower
 * (or anyone) sells a small quantity into the bid to print a low last price,
 * every loan collateralised by that asset marks down at once, and liquidations
 * fire across the book at a price nobody could have got size at. Run the other
 * way, a borrower prints a HIGH last price and draws principal against
 * collateral that is not worth it — and that loss lands on the reserve.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES ABOUT IT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does not pretend to fix it. It does three things that are worth more than
 * pretending:
 *
 *   1. Makes the mark an explicit PORT, so the day an index price exists it is
 *      one adapter and no change to any money path.
 *   2. Refuses marks that fail stated sanity checks — stale, non-positive, or
 *      moved further in one interval than a real market does — instead of
 *      liquidating against them.
 *   3. Distinguishes what a mark is good enough FOR. A margin call on a
 *      questionable mark costs the borrower a notification. A liquidation on a
 *      questionable mark costs them their collateral. Those are not the same
 *      decision and this file does not let them share a threshold.
 *
 * ── THE CROSS-STREAM ASK, stated rather than smuggled ────────────────────────
 *
 * svc-trade belongs to another agent and is not edited here. What loans need
 * from it, in the order they matter:
 *
 *   (a) An INDEX price per market — mid-of-book or a short TWAP, explicitly not
 *       `last` — carrying its own `asOf` and a depth figure at some band, so a
 *       consumer can tell a real price from a printed one.
 *   (b) A DEPTH read at a price band, so `maxTrancheBps` can be sized against
 *       the book that actually exists rather than a fixed guess.
 *   (c) Eventually, orders funded from a `collateral` pot, so a liquidation can
 *       walk a real book. Until then `loanLiquidate` sells to a named
 *       counterparty at a marked price — atomic and honest, but not a match.
 *
 * Until (a) lands, `TickerPriceSource` reads mid-of-book where a two-sided
 * quote exists and falls back to `last` where it does not, and it labels which
 * it used so `MarkPolicy` can refuse to liquidate on the weaker one.
