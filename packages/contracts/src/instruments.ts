/**
 * THE INSTRUMENT MODEL — one shape for crypto, commodities and forex (§5.2).
 *
 * The exchange was crypto-shaped: `trade.markets` carried a symbol, a pair, a
 * tick and a lot, and nothing else, because every market it described was open
 * every second of every day. Doctrine §5.2 already says forex is "the same
 * engine, `kind:spot` with fiat pairs" — but "the same engine" is only true once
 * the *listing* can say the three things a non-crypto market has and a crypto
 * market does not:
 *
 *   1. **What class of thing is this.** A gold order and a BTC order are not the
 *      same product to a regulator, a risk engine, or a tax report.
 *   2. **What one unit means.** `BTC/USDT` prices one coin. `XAU/USD` prices one
 *      TROY OUNCE, `WTI/USD` one BARREL, `NATGAS/USD` one MMBtu. A quantity
 *      without its unit is a number, not a size.
 *   3. **When it trades.** Crypto is continuous. Forex runs Sunday evening to
 *      Friday evening New York time. CME metals and energy close for an hour
 *      every weekday afternoon Chicago time. A market that cannot say it is shut
 *      will accept an order it cannot possibly fill, hold the user's funds
 *      against it, and only discover the problem when a human asks why.
 *
 * WHY THE SCHEDULE IS IN AN IANA TIMEZONE AND NOT IN UTC. The forex week is
 * defined by the 17:00 New York close, not by a UTC offset — so the UTC instant
 * it happens at moves by an hour twice a year, and the US and EU do not shift on
 * the same weekend. A schedule pinned to UTC is therefore correct for most of
 * the year and quietly wrong for the rest, in both directions. Resolving through
 * `Intl` with a real timezone costs nothing (it is in the runtime) and is right
 * on every date, including the ones nobody tests.
 *
 * Money here obeys the same rule it obeys everywhere: DECIMAL STRINGS on the
 * wire, parsed to scaled bigint before arithmetic (Doctrine §0.6). There is not
 * a `number` in this file that describes a price or a size.
