/**
 * SECRET SCAN — no credential-shaped literal in a tracked file.
 *
 * WHY THIS RULE EXISTS, in the words of what actually happened here.
 *
 * The vendored Java platform arrived with ~40 credentials sitting in tracked
 * `application.properties` files: Redis passwords, an SMTP password, cloud
 * access key pairs, SMS gateway passwords, captcha private keys, MongoDB URIs
 * with embedded credentials, block-explorer API keys, a signing-key password.
 *
 * One of them was not decoration. `security.user.password` guarded the Spring
 * Boot actuator on a service whose port is published to 0.0.0.0. Anyone holding
 * a copy of this repository could authenticate to `/uc/monitor/heapdump` and
 * download the entire process heap — every secret in memory, every in-flight
 * user record. That was proven against the running fleet, not theorised.
 *
 * The lesson is not "be careful with secrets". It is that a committed credential
 * is invisible: it reviews as a config line, it survives every rebrand, and the
 * day it becomes reachable nobody re-reads the file. So the check is mechanical.
 *
 * WHAT IT ENFORCES
 *
 * For every assignment whose KEY looks like a credential (password, secret,
 * token, api key, access key, private key), the VALUE must be one of:
 *
 *   1. An environment placeholder — `${VAR}`. The service reads it from the
 *      environment and, because there is no `:-default`, refuses to start
 *      without it. This is the outcome we want.
 *   2. Empty. Nothing to leak.
 *   3. An obvious, self-declaring placeholder (see PLACEHOLDER_VALUES). It has
 *      to announce itself; "hunter2" does not count.
 *
 * Anything else fails. It also flags URLs carrying inline `user:password@`
 * credentials, which the key-name check alone would miss — `spring.data.mongodb.uri`
 * is not a credential-shaped key but it carried one.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A HIGH-ENTROPY SCANNER. Entropy heuristics fire on minified
 * bundles, lockfile hashes, git SHAs and base64 images, and a gate that cries
 * wolf is a gate people learn to bypass with --no-verify. This checks a narrow
 * thing exactly.
 *
 * ── 2026-08-03: SOURCE FILES ARE NOW SCANNED TOO ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The paragraph above used to say a secret in a `.java`/`.ts` file was "a
 * different, rarer problem". That was wrong, and the A1.4 audit
 * (docs/A1.4-WALLET-SECRETS-PERIMETER-2026-07-30.md) only looked like it swept
 * the vendored tree because it swept `.properties`. Reading source found a
 * live third-party captcha key pair hard-coded in a controller of a PUBLISHED,
 * RUNNING jar, and a node credential inside a URL in a test's `main()`. Neither
 * was visible to any gate.
 *
 * Source is scanned, but NOT with the config rules — running the key/value
 * check over 1,854 source files is the "cries wolf" failure this file's own
 * comments warn about. Source gets three narrow checks instead:
 *
 *   1. `inline-url-credential` — a `scheme://user:pass@host` literal. Runs on
 *      EVERYTHING including test files: a test that embeds a credentialled URL
 *      is pointing at a real host, which is precisely the shape of the ACT and
 *      Mongo findings. Measured across the tree: 2 hits, both genuine.
 *   2. `source-credential-literal` — a credential-NAMED identifier declared
 *      equal to a string literal. Skipped in test files, where such a constant
 *      is a fixture by construction (`const SECRET = 'a-mount-test-secret'`);
 *      scanning them costs one false positive per test file and teaches
 *      nothing. Measured: 33 hits with tests, 4 without, all 4 genuine.
 *   3. `wallet-signing-literal` — under `01_wallet_rpc` only, a string literal
 *      passed positionally into a `sendFrom`/`transfer`/`withdraw` call. No
 *      identifier and no URL to key off; the tell is that a signing call is
 *      being handed a constant. Measured in that tree: 1 hit, genuine.
 *
 * ── THE KNOWN-DISCLOSED REGISTER ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Widening a gate over a vendored tree you cannot compile means finding things
 * whose FIX is an owner decision, not a code edit. Two bad answers exist:
 * exempt the path (hides it forever) or fail the build (the gate gets deleted
 * within a week). So registered findings are printed loudly on every single run
 * with their rotation-doc reference, and do not fail. Anything NOT registered
 * fails.
 *
 * The register cannot rot: an entry whose file/line no longer produces the
 * violation it claims is itself a FAILURE. You cannot park a finding here and
 * let the code move out from under it.
 *
 * Exit 0 = no unregistered credential-shaped literal is tracked, and every
 * register entry still describes a real finding. Exit 1 = one landed, or the
 * register is stale.
