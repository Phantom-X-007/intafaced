 * Second, the scheduled jobs (standing-order runner, accrual, risk sweep,
 * auto-invest, pending resume) are NOT user-callable and not treasury-session
 * callable. They are HMAC as `svc-bank`, matching POST /internal/jobs/*. A

 * A MESSAGE IS A WIRE FORMAT.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * An error string that interpolates a value crosses a trust boundary the moment
 * a mapper passes it through, so `err.message` reaching a client is a
 * SERIALISATION DECISION rather than a debugging convenience. Every branch of
 * `toTrpcError` below now makes that decision explicitly, and the two rules it
 * makes are:
 *
 *   1. A refusal may only DESCRIBE objects the caller was already entitled to
 *      see. Where it cannot, it says so and names nothing.
 *   2. Nothing is passed through by DEFAULT. The `default:` branch used to
 *      return `err.message` verbatim for every code nobody had thought about,
 *      which is how `Space "Holiday fund" is archived` — a sentence written for
 *      an owner — ended up being delivered to a stranger who guessed a uuid.
 *   3. Ramp / card refusals the user reads are catalog keys via `@intafaced/i18n`.
 *      Missing keys render as the dotted code — never invented English.
 *
 * Rule 2 is why the switch is exhaustive over `BankErrorCode` and the default
 * carries a `never` assignment: adding a code without deciding what a caller
 * may be told now fails the typecheck instead of silently becoming a 400 with
 * the domain sentence attached.

 *     fact: a uuid the caller ALREADY OBTAINED belongs to someone else. An
 *     attacker who has the id has, by construction, already been somewhere they

 * THE DESTINATION GATE — what a caller may be told about somebody else's space.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `transfers.create` and `transfers.schedule` each name TWO spaces and
 * owner-check ONE (see the written reason at those call sites). That is correct
 * for safety and it is the product. It was not correct for disclosure.
 *
 * `space-service.ts` writes its refusals for the person who owns the space:
 * `Space "Holiday fund" is archived`, `Cannot transfer USDT into a EUR space`.
 * Delivered to the owner those sentences are the most useful thing this service
 * says. Delivered to a stranger who guessed a uuid they are an oracle over
 * another user's accounts — existence, the user's own chosen NAME, and the
 * asset — for the price of a transfer that does not even have to succeed.
 *
 * So the message is not the bug and neither is the missing check. The bug is
 * that nothing between them decided whether THIS caller may hear it. This
 * function is that decision, and it has exactly two outcomes:
 *
 *   · the destination is the caller's       → return, and every refusal below
 *                                             reaches them intact, name and all
 *   · it is not, or there is no such space  → `NOT_FOUND`, naming NOTHING, and
 *                                             BYTE-IDENTICAL between the two
 *
 * The second bullet is the whole rule. "Exists but is not yours" and "does not
 * exist" are one answer here — not a lie, because relative to this caller there
 * is no such space in any sense they are entitled to.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: refuse the transfer. Paying a stranger is
 * the product (`bank-service.test.ts` pins that value moves between two
 * different users' spaces), so a destination that is somebody else's, live, and
 * in the right asset proceeds exactly as before. Only the FAILURES stop
 * describing it.
 *
 * The three conditions checked here are the three `space-service.ts` refuses a
 * credit on, and they are re-checked inside `TransferService` where they are
 * ENFORCED. This is not a second enforcement point; it is a disclosure gate
 * that happens to have to know the same three facts.

   * Settled release stays all-or-nothing on `close`. Partial release of excess
