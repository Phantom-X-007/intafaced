/**
 * CREW MATCHING — "complementary-profile heuristics" (§7.1).
 *
 * Pure. No I/O, no clock, no randomness. Every function in this file is a
 * total function of its arguments, which is what makes the guarantee testable:
 *
 *     the same user, scored against the same crews, is placed in the same crew.
 *
 * ── Why complementary and not similar ───────────────────────────────────────
 * A crew of four people who all decide analytically, all wake at dawn and all
 * learn by reading is a crew with one perspective and four voices. The whole
 * value of a crew is that someone in it sees what you do not. So the score
 * rewards *difference* — a candidate scores highest against the crew that
 * shares least with them.
 *
 * ── Why categorical axes and integer basis points ───────────────────────────
 * The axes are categories, not positions on a line: 'intuitive' is not
 * two-thirds of the way to 'decisive', and pretending otherwise would invent a
 * geometry the engine never claimed. So "difference" means "not equal", and the
 * score is a weighted count.
 *
 * The count is then scaled to basis points with integer division. Not because
 * floats would be non-deterministic (IEEE 754 is deterministic), but because
 * the score is persisted in `match_runs.scores`, compared across processes and
 * asserted on in tests — and an integer says exactly what it is in all three
 * places, with no formatting question and no `0.30000000000000004`.
