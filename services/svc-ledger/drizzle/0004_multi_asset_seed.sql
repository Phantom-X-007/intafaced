-- svc-ledger · seed the commodity and forex assets (§4.2)
-- Reversal: 0004_multi_asset_seed.down.sql
--
-- These are the assets `packages/contracts/src/instruments.ts` lists markets in.
-- `CATALOGUE_ASSETS` in that file is the authority and a test asserts its
-- contents; this file must carry every entry, because a market whose asset has
-- no row here fails at the first ledger post rather than at listing time.
--
-- Following 0000's precedent exactly: adding an asset is a data change, never a
-- code change, and the insert is idempotent so the file is re-runnable.
--
-- DECIMALS. This is the scale the ledger reconciles the asset at, and it is not
-- cosmetic — it is how much of a position can exist below the smallest amount
-- anyone can see.
--   · Fiat currencies at 2, matching the existing USD/EUR/GBP rows. JPY is
--     conventionally quoted to 0 decimal places as a currency, but it is stored
--     at 2 like every other fiat here: a JPY *balance* still needs sub-unit
--     precision to hold the remainder of a USD/JPY fill, and a currency that
--     cannot represent its own fill remainder accumulates rounding dust.
--   · Commodities at 8. A troy ounce of gold is worth enough that 2 decimals
--     would make the smallest representable holding a material sum, and the
--     lot size on XAU/USD is 0.01 oz.
