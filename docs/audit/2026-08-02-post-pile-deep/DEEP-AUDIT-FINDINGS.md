# Deep post-pile audit — findings + fixes (not the thin seal)

**Date:** 2026-08-02  
**Tip base:** `3b33fe0` (+ this ship)  
**Why this exists:** First post-pile WAVE-AUDIT was a **scan seal** (CX-8 + greps). That was too thin for “audit insane amounts.” This pass used **adversarial code review** (4 parallel deep audits) + surgical fixes.

**Plan parent:** `docs/POST-PILE-AUDIT-HARDEN-PLAN-2026-08-02.md`  
**Collision:** no #346 pay implement · no shehzad M2–M7 engines · #390 UI craft parallel — only honesty money UI fixes

| Earlier claim                     | Truth after deep audit                                                                                      |

| Private WS hardened in production | **Unit-true, process-false** — public upgrade 404’d private path                                            |
| Kill switch “lets users out”      | **Orders only** — futures position close was trapped                                                        |

## 3 · Method (so cold agents continue depth)

1. Parallel adversarial reviewers on trade money · dual-book · edge/WS · vendor UI
2. Confirm each P0 in source before code
3. Fix + regression test where feasible
4. Do **not** declare P0=0 after greps alone
