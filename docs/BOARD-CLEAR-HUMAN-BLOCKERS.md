# Board Clear — Human blockers (deferred queue)

**Rule:** Append only while agent residual remains. This file **is** the Nitro inbox — do not create `docs/ops/NITRO-INBOX.md`.  
**Flush:** After AGENT-COMPLETE (all agent-owned rows Done/Cut), orchestrator finalizes this file and reports once.

**Agent residual remaining?** **Yes (partial)** — shell freeProduct often 0, but platform M1–M7 + Class X + infra blockers remain.  
**Last refresh:** 2026-08-04 (install / cost emergency).

**Ownership note (2026-08-04):** Shehzad is **Protocol Plane + INTACHAIN only** (THREE-WAY + GITHUB-OWNERSHIP-SHEHZAD). Pay/bank/futures/identity residual reclaimed for Nitro agents after #346 handoff. Tip law wins over stale M1–M7 rows below.

## Deferred X1–X5 (Nitro only / Denon admin)

## Mountain rows still open — with who actually owns them on tip

**This table used to read `shehzad002` on all eight rows. Six of those locks were dissolved by the 2026-08-04 law** (THREE-WAY-DISTRIBUTION §2 + GITHUB-OWNERSHIP-SHEHZAD): Shehzad is Protocol Plane + INTACHAIN only, so only the two `protocol.*` rows are still a human blocker. The prose note above said this; the table did not, and a table that contradicts the sentence above it is read as the lock. Corrected below.

| Row                        | Owner on tip                      | What’s left (honest)                                                                         | Waiting on                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| pay.gateway (+ expand)     | shehzad002 **until #346 handoff** | Card sandbox + KYB + durable list — PR #346 open and CONFLICTING                             | shehzad merge fix **or** handoff comment |
| protocol.smart-accounts    | **shehzad002** (chain)            | Deploy + audit package                                                                       | S-A1 — genuine human blocker             |
| protocol.amm (+ lending/…) | **shehzad002** (chain)            | After SA                                                                                     | S-A2 — genuine human blocker             |
| trade.futures              | **Nitro agents** (was M3)         | Risk/margin/liq/mark truth; unlocks B-WS-2 live positions. Implement from D-S-01, not invent | Denon spec, not a human lock             |
| trade.otc / copy / algo    | **Nitro agents** (was M4)         | Real engines. Agents must not invent mids/rates — thin §13 or from tip law                   | Denon spec, not a human lock             |

| Phase 5 bank money         | **Nitro agents** (was M6)         | `bank.earn` shipped `done` 2026-08-04; cards ledger half + ramps crypto leg remain           | nothing — claimable                      |
| dual-book / Java residual  | **Nitro agents** (was M7)         | After path-clear vs Denon open custody PRs                                                   | Denon open PR file sets                  |

**Still a real human blocker on this table:** the two `protocol.*` rows, and `pay.gateway` only until #346 is finished or handed off. Everything else is agent work under Class M rigor — Class X (issuer keys, prod go-live, licence) stays Nitro human wherever it appears, which is a decision gate, not an ownership lock.

### Agent §13 residual (not a human steal)

| ID     | Row        | Socket                                                                 | Owner after |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| B-WS-2 | ws.gateway | Live futures **position** private stream E2E — needs correct M3 events | M3 + agent  |

## Last flush

**2026-08-04** — Cost + protection blockers written to X1–X5 (were empty since 2026-08-02).  
Human M1–M7 still OPEN → BOARD-COMPLETE not claimed.  
Agent residual = F-STANDBY / P1–P5 ladder when freeProduct=0 — not stamp mills.

**2026-08-04 (later)** — Mountain table re-derived against the 2026-08-04 ownership law. M3–M7 are **not** human blockers and had been reading as locks for as long as the table was the only thing anyone scrolled to; X1–X5 unchanged and still Denon. Human blockers now: X1–X5, `protocol.smart-accounts`, `protocol.amm`, and `pay.gateway` until #346 resolves. BOARD-COMPLETE still not claimed.
