/**
 * THE HALF THAT WAS MISSING.
 *
 * svc-notify's `bankMarginCalled` consumer has been complete since svc-notify
 * shipped and parked on a stream nothing created, so a margin call started a
 * grace clock gating liquidation and the borrower was never told. These assert
 * the publish, not the notification — whether the borrower was reached is
 * svc-notify's answer and is allowed to be "no". What must never again be "no"
 * is whether anything carried the call at all.
 *
 * No database and no NATS. `MemoryEventBus` validates on the PRODUCER side
 * through the same `validatePayload` the real bus uses, so a payload this
 * accepts is one JetStream would accept — which is the only thing worth
 * certifying here.
