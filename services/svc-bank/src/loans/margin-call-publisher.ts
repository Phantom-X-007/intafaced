/**
 * THE MARGIN CALL, ON THE BUS.
 *
 * ── What was broken ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `bankMarginCalled` was a complete event with a complete consumer and no
 * publisher. svc-notify's handler was finished — severity `critical`, business
 * key `<loanId>:<sequence>`, the lot — and parked on a stream that had never
 * existed, logging that it could not attach on every boot since it shipped.
 *
 * So a margin call started a grace clock that gates liquidation, and the
 * borrower was never told. `risk.ts` argues at length against exactly that
 * outcome — "the borrower's first notice of the loan would be its liquidation
 * receipt" — and the ordering guarantee it wrote to prevent it was, in
 * production, guaranteeing an interval of silence rather than an interval of
 * warning. The call was raised. Nothing carried it. This file is the transport.
 *
 * ── The split this implements, from the catalog docstring ───────────────────
 *
 * "This subject exists so that RAISING a call and TELLING the borrower stay two
 *  separable facts. svc-bank writes the call durably — a `loan_margin_calls`
 *  row whose grace clock gates liquidation — and publishes this. Whether the
 *  borrower was actually reached is svc-notify's answer, recorded per channel,
 *  and it is allowed to be 'no'."
 *
 * Which is why this is a `MarginCallSink` and not a call inside the risk sweep.
 * The row is written and committed first, by `raiseMarginCall`; this runs after
 * it, and a failure here is caught by the caller and written to `notify_error`
 * rather than rolled back. A margin call that exists with a grace clock running
 * is a real margin call even if the publish bounced, and a borrower disputing a
 * liquidation later is owed both halves of that story rather than an all-or-
 * nothing that would have silently un-called the loan when NATS was down.
 *
 * ── Idempotency ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `<loanId>:<sequence>`, the same business key the consumer dedupes on, and the
 * reason `sequence` is on the payload at all rather than only in a header. A
 * loan can be called, cured and called again: the second call is a different
 * fact that must produce a second notification, so keying on `loanId` alone
 * would swallow every call after the first. Keying on the envelope id instead
 * would notify twice on a redelivered publish. Both failures land on somebody
 * being liquidated, in opposite directions.
 *
 * ── Not a money event ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing moves. `cureCollateralAmount` is what the borrower would have to ADD
 * to clear the call — a figure quoted at one mark, not a balance and not a
 * movement — and it crosses as a decimal string like every other amount on this
 * bus (§0.6, §10). No ledger recipe is touched from here.
