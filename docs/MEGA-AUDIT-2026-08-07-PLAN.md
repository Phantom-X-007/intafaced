# MEGA AUDIT — 2026-08-07 · Plan and scope

**Status:** COMPLETE — findings delivered, and the remediation ledger in §0a of the findings
document records which fixes have since landed on `main` and which are still open.
**Findings land in:** [`MEGA-AUDIT-2026-08-07-FINDINGS.md`](MEGA-AUDIT-2026-08-07-FINDINGS.md)

> **SCOPE CORRECTED MID-RUN — read this before the numbers below.**
> This plan was written against `0e46b7a3` (`docs/phase-b-v2-leverage-audit`), the branch in the
> main checkout. That branch turned out to be **203 commits behind `origin/main`** and to
> contribute **zero** commits to it. The run was stopped and restarted against the true tip
> `6a4a360a` (#971) in a clean worktree.
> **Every size, count and target in §2 below is therefore the OLD measurement** — kept as the
> record of what was planned. The corrected figures (742 source files, 270 test files, 27 gates,
> `vendor/upstream-exchange`, `+2` packages) are in **§0 of the findings document**, which is the
> live one.

This is a **code and systems** audit. It is deliberately not another methodology audit —
`BOARD-CLEAR-MEGA-AUDIT-2026-08-01.md` and `MULTI-AGENT-METHOD-AUDIT-2026-08-07.md` already
own process. This one goes at the software.

## 1 · The thesis

This repo has an unusually strong gate apparatus: **23 doctrine gates**, a mutation-tested
secret scanner, a skip-honesty scan, an event-wiring scan, a law-to-board coverage matrix.
Twenty-two of them are green.

That is exactly why re-running the gates is **not** where the value is. Every gate defines
its own blind spot by its scope. The value of a mega audit on a repo like this is finding
**what passes all 23 gates and is still wrong**.

So the audit has two halves:

- **Half A — the code**: money invariants, security, concurrency, failure modes, contracts.
- **Half B — the machine that judges the code**: do the gates catch what they claim, do the
  193 test files actually assert anything, does local `verify` match CI, do the docs match
  reality.

Half B is what a normal review never does, and it is where a false green light lives.

**Already proven by first contact:** the `brand` gate walks `.pnpm-store/`, `.tools/pnpm/store/`
and `.worktrees/` and reports **1215 false positives**, so `pnpm verify` is red locally for a
reason that does not exist in CI. That is the exact CI-vs-local drift `tooling/ci/gates.mjs`
was written to prevent, living inside the file that prevents it. It also means an agent who
runs the canonical command sees red and learns to route around it.

## 2 · The real surface (measured, not assumed)

**Per-workspace sizing (LOC · source files · test files)** — this is what drives target ranking:

Bolded test counts are the ones that make a service dangerous regardless of what the code says.

## 3 · Twelve lenses

Each lens is a distinct way to be wrong. They are assigned to targets deliberately — not as a
cross-product, because a uniform sweep over 600 files is the "wasted work" the brief forbids.

| #   | Lens                             | What it hunts                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| L1  | **Money invariants**             | conservation / double-entry, `number` used for money, decimal→bigint scaling, rounding direction and who eats the dust, negative balance, fee math, atomic settlement, replay and idempotency, §0.6 "no module holds its own balance" |
| L2  | **Security**                     | authn bypass, missing authz per route, IDOR, injection, SSRF, secret handling and logging, JWT/session, rate limits, admin surface, killswitch reachability                                                                           |

| L6  | **Contract drift**               | `packages/contracts` vs service implementations vs the vendored shell's expectations; the 32-event catalog vs actual emitters/consumers, including the 18 declared-but-unwired "recorded sockets"                                     |
| L7  | **Error handling / data loss**   | anywhere a failure silently loses a write, an event, or money                                                                                                                                                                         |

| L9  | **Docs truth**                   | 170 docs vs code reality — every load-bearing claim re-derived or marked stale                                                                                                                                                        |

## 4 · Execution shape

**Phase 0 — baseline, run by the lead (done / in flight).** Every machine-state claim in this
audit is RAN-IT, not quoted from a doc.

- `node tooling/ci/gates.mjs` → 22/23 green, `brand` red (see §1)
- full `turbo run typecheck --continue`
- full `turbo run test --continue`
- toolchain: node v26.3.1, repo-local pnpm 10.25.0 at `.tools/bin/pnpm`, **Docker not running**
  → integration suites that need Postgres are out of reach this session and are reported as
  _not run_, never as passing.

**Phase 1 — FIND.** Parallel deep readers, one per (target × lens) pair, each returning
structured findings with file, line, mechanism, and a concrete failure scenario. No agent is
allowed to report a finding it cannot anchor to a line.

**Phase 2 — REFUTE.** Every finding goes to independent adversarial verifiers whose brief is
to **kill it**, defaulting to "refuted" under uncertainty. Critical and high findings get three
verifiers with different lenses (correctness / does-it-actually-reproduce / is-it-already-guarded).
This is the step that keeps hallucinated findings away from Nitro.

**Phase 3 — LEAD REVIEW.** Money and security findings that survive are re-read personally by
the lead agent against the source, not delegated. Safety-critical diff review is never a
subagent's call.

**Phase 4 — SYNTHESIS.** One ranked remediation ledger: severity, blast radius, the fix, and
the cheapest check that would have caught it.

## 6 · Guardrails held throughout

- **Read-only.** No source file is edited, nothing is committed, nothing is pushed. The output
  is findings plus prescriptions. Fixes are a separate green light.
- **No work on Shehzad chain mountains** — `svc-protocol`, `svc-dex`, INTACHAIN are audited and
  reported, never implemented.
- The working tree is dirty and shared; the audit does not touch it.
- Anything not actually executed is labelled **not run**, never inferred green.
