/**
 * The compiled contracts, loaded from `contracts/out/`.
 *
 * `contracts/*.sol` used to be source nobody had ever run through a compiler —
 * `abi.ts` still says so in its header, and it was true until
 * `scripts/compile-contracts.mjs` landed. This module is the seam between the
 * committed build output and everything that needs it: the dev-chain deployer,
 * and the tests that check the TypeScript in this service against the Solidity
 * it claims to mirror.
 *
 * ── One caller IS on a request path now, and has to be ─────────────────────
 *
 * This used to say "not on any request path": the service read chain state
 * through the hand-written ABI in `abi.ts`, nothing here was imported at boot,
 * and a missing `contracts/out` could therefore only ever be a build-time
 * problem.
 *
 * `src/launch/address.ts` changes that, unavoidably. A smart account is an
 * EIP-1167 clone whose creation code is 55 bytes derivable from constants; a
 * launched token is a full contract, so its CREATE2 init code IS the compiler's
 * `bytecode` output. There is no way to predict a token address without it.
 *
 * The guarantee is preserved rather than dropped: that module calls
 * `loadArtifact` ONCE at import, so a missing artefact fails the service at
 * BOOT rather than surfacing as a 500 on a creator's first launch — or, far
 * worse, as an address derived from bytecode that is not there. Read its header
 * before adding a second request-path caller.
 *
 * The path is resolved from `import.meta.url` rather than `process.cwd()` so it
 * works the same from `src/` under vitest, from `dist/` under node, and from
 * `scripts/` under tsx — all three sit exactly two levels below the service root.

 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * `runtime === artifact.deployedBytecode` IS FALSE FOR A CORRECT DEPLOYMENT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Solidity `immutable` variables are not storage. The compiler emits ZERO
 * placeholders for them inside the runtime code and the constructor splices the
 * real values in, so the bytes on chain genuinely differ from the compiler's
 * `deployedBytecode` — by exactly the immutables and nothing else.
 *
 * `SovereignToken` has three (`decimals`, `totalSupply`, `initialHolder`), so a
 * byte-equality check rejects every legitimately launched token. This was
 * written the obvious way first and caught by deploying one and looking at the
 * diff: `12` where the artefact had `00` was `decimals = 18`.
 *
 * The failure mode of getting this wrong is not a broken feature, it is a
 * DISHONEST one — a "verified against the audited template" badge that is
 * permanently false would train everyone to ignore it, which is worse than not
 * having it.
 *
 * So the immutable ranges are masked on BOTH sides and everything else must
 * match byte for byte. What that still catches is the whole point: a factory
 * that deploys a different token, a template swapped after the fact, a proxy
 * where a real contract should be.
