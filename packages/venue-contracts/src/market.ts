/**
 * THE UNIFIED INSTRUMENT — §27's "one typed contract … normalised across CEXs,
 * DEXs/chains, and FX/CFD rails".
 *
 * ── Why normalisation is the whole product ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every venue describes the same instrument differently, and the differences
 * are not cosmetic: one publishes a tick size, another a number of decimal
 * places; one quotes a perpetual in the base asset, another in the quote; one
 * calls it `BTCUSDT`, another `BTC-USD-SWAP`, a third `tBTCUSD`. Routing across
 * venues means comparing prices for the same thing, and "the same thing" has to
 * be a decision somebody made in code rather than a coincidence of naming.
 *
 * ── Precision is a size, not a count ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `pricePrecision` is a TICK — the smallest price increment, as an `Amount`.
 * Not "8 decimal places". Two reasons:
 *
 *   · A count cannot express a tick of `0.5` or `25`, and index and FX
 *     instruments use exactly those. A venue with a 25-point tick and a
 *     decimal-count model rounds every order to a price the venue rejects.
 *   · An `Amount` is already the type every price in this platform is in, so
 *     rounding an order to a tick is one `div`/`mul` in the same scale rather
 *     than a `toFixed` — which returns a string via a float.
 *
 * ── What is NOT here ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There is no `info` field carrying the venue's raw payload. CCXT has one and
 * it is how venue-specific behaviour leaks into supposedly-unified callers: the
 * moment a caller reads `market.info.someVenueField`, the abstraction has been
 * defeated and nobody can tell by reading the caller. If the fabric needs a
 * field, the field gets normalised here and named.
