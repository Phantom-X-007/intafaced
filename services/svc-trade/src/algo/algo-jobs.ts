/**
 * TWAP slice scheduler (D-S-04 / trade.algo).
 *
 * Default OFF. This is the thing that was missing: `tickAllAlgos()` existed,
 * was correct, and had **zero callers**, so a user could create a TWAP, watch
 * it persist to Postgres, and never receive a single child order. The schedule
 * sat `active` forever.
 *
 * It invents nothing. Every slice still goes through `TwapEngine.tick`, which
 * gates on the mark, probes real book liquidity, and places children through
 * the ordinary `placeOrder` path with the ordinary holds and risk gates. This
 * file only decides WHEN to ask.
 *
 * Mount is legal only with ADR 2026-08-08 (interval is the promise / re-space
 * overdue) and the cancel honesty fixes in the same change — otherwise a tick
 * outage or resume turns a TWAP into a market-order burst, and a restart cancel
 * can flip the parent cancelled while children stay live.
 *
 * ── Why the interval is capped, not just defaulted ──────────────────────────
 *
 * `tickAll` emits at most ONE slice per parent per tick. So if this interval is
 * longer than a parent's `sliceIntervalMs`, the schedule silently STRETCHES and
 * never catches up — a 30-minute TWAP quietly becoming a 3-hour one, with no
 * miss recorded because nothing was missed. The engine's floor for
 * `sliceIntervalMs` is 1s, so this interval must be ≤ 1s to keep any legal
 * schedule on time. That is enforced in `env.ts` rather than trusted here.
 *
 * ── What this does NOT solve ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `job-host` has no leader election, so every replica that boots with the flag
 * on runs every job. Child placement survives that — `clientOrderId` is
 * `algo:{parentId}:{sliceIndex}`, which derives a deterministic order id, so a
 * duplicate tick finds the original order rather than placing a second one.
 * The parent's `misses[]` array is last-write-wins across replicas, so a miss
 * record can be lost, which is an honesty regression rather than a money one.
 * Run one instance, or add an advisory lock, before running more.
