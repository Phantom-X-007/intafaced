 * The console's route to the switch that halts ALL value movement (§4.2, §14.6).
 *
 * Separate from `/api/kill-switch` because it is a separate authority. Module
 * halts travel on `ADMIN_OPERATOR_TOKEN` (`admin:write`); this travels on
 * `ADMIN_TREASURY_TOKEN` (`admin:treasury`), and a console configured with only
 * the first cannot stop the money plane. `svc-edge` enforces the split
 * independently — this route respects it, it does not decide it.
 *
 * Every answer from below is passed through with its own status, including the
 * failures. An operator told the platform is halted when it is not walks away
 * from a book that is still accepting writes.
