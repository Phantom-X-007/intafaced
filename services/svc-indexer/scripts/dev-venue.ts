/**
 * THE DEV CHAIN, FROM THE INDEXER'S SIDE — everything that must never ship.
 *
 * This file lives in `scripts/`, not `src/`, and that is load-bearing.
 * `tsconfig.json` includes only `src/**`, so nothing here is compiled into
 * `dist/` and nothing here can be imported by the running service.
 * `src/sovereignty.test.ts` asserts, over every `.ts` under `src/`, that this
 * service creates no wallet client and derives no account from a key — and that
 * assertion stays true precisely because the only key in svc-indexer sits in a
 * file the service cannot reach. svc-protocol draws the same line in
 * `scripts/dev-chain.ts` for the same reason.

 *
 * `test test test test test test test test test test test junk` is the phrase
 * Foundry, Hardhat and Ganache all print to the terminal on every start. Anyone
 * can spend anything its accounts hold on any chain, which is exactly why it must
 * only ever touch a chain whose entire state is disposable.
 *
 * `assertDisposableChain` is what enforces that: it refuses to sign unless the
 * endpoint identifies itself as anvil/hardhat AND reports the dev chain id. It is
 * duplicated from svc-protocol rather than imported because the guard is four
 * lines and the alternative is a runtime dependency between two services for the
 * benefit of a test fixture — the compiler pin is worth sharing (see
 * `contract-sources.mjs`); a `web3_clientVersion` check is not.
