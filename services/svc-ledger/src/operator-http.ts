/**
 * THE LEDGER'S OPERATOR SURFACE — and the switch that was wired to nothing.
 *
 * ── The finding this file exists to close ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `ledger.posting` is described in `packages/config/src/flags.ts` as "the most
 * consequential switch in the platform", and every piece of it was already
 * built and correct:
 *
 *   · `posting_freeze` is a durable singleton row, not a process field, so
 *     every replica reads the same answer (migration 0002_durable_freeze).
 *   · It carries `reason`, `actor` and `changed_at`, and the DATABASE refuses a
 *     freeze with neither reason nor actor (`posting_freeze_attributed_ck`).
 *   · `LedgerService.freeze/unfreeze` emit `ledger.freeze.updated`.
 *   · `createLedgerRouter` exposes `freeze`, `unfreeze` and `reconcile` behind
 *     `scopedProcedure('admin:treasury')` — an interactive-only scope, so MFA
 *     is enforced by `requireScope` itself.
 *
 * **And none of it was reachable.** `index.ts` builds `appRouter` and exports it
 * for its TYPE; nothing registers a tRPC plugin, so those three procedures were
 * served on no port. `s2s-http.ts` already says this out loud about `post` —
 * "A guard written on one door does not secure the other one" — and the same
 * sentence was true of the freeze, in the other direction: not an unguarded
 * door, but no door at all. `svc-ledger` is also deliberately absent from
 * `svc-edge`'s route table, so there was no path from `apps/admin` either.
 *
 * The only way to freeze the ledger was `LEDGER_POSTING_ENABLED=false` and a
 * restart — and per `service.ts`, that flag "can freeze, and can never thaw".
 * So the platform's emergency stop was reachable only by redeploying, and
 * releasing it required a second redeploy. `apps/admin` has shipped a red
 * "Halt posting" button, with a typed confirmation, that set React state.
 *
 * ── Why raw routes and not a tRPC mount ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Mounting `appRouter` would serve the whole router, including `post`, on a
 * port. `post` is `serviceProcedure` so it would still refuse a user token —
 * but the reason svc-ledger has no HTTP router today is a deliberate one, and
 * widening the money plane's surface to reach operator switches inverts the
 * cost. These handlers mirror `registerS2sHttp`'s shape: explicit, enumerable,
 * one line each, and nothing reachable that is not named here.
 *
 * Routes: GET/POST `/operator/freeze`, POST `/operator/unfreeze`,
 * POST `/operator/reconcile`. Reconcile was the residual of the original
 * freeze-only ship — freeze was wired first because halt is more urgent than
 * audit, and apps/admin kept an honest-simulated reconcile button until this
 * path existed for edge to proxy.
 *
 * ── Authentication ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `admin:treasury`, which is in `INTERACTIVE_ONLY_SCOPES`, so `requireScope`
 * rejects a token without `mfa` on its own. No session carries it
 * (`SESSION_SCOPES` excludes every `admin:*` scope and `auth.test.ts` asserts
 * that), and `assertDelegatableScopes` refuses to mint an API key with it.
 *
 * Not the internal service secret, which is what `post` uses. A shared secret
 * has no subject, and `posting_freeze.actor` is a column whose whole purpose is
 * to name who halted the platform. "Somebody with the key" is not an audit
 * trail.
