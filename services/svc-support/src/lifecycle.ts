/**
 * TICKET LIFECYCLE — which status moves are legal, as data.
 *
 * Before this table `setStatus` accepted any status for any ticket, because the
 * only validation was zod's "is this one of the four words". That let a desk do
 * two things it should not:
 *
 *   1. Re-open a CLOSED ticket. Closed is the one terminal state a desk has;
 *      if it can be re-opened silently then "closed" means nothing and the
 *      audit trail of a finished complaint can still grow.
 *   2. Move a ticket to the status it already has, writing an audit row that
 *      records no change. A trail full of `open → open` is a trail nobody
 *      reads, which is the same as not having one.
 *
 * `resolved → open` IS legal and deliberately so: a user replying "this is not
 * fixed" must be able to reach a human without opening a second ticket that
 * loses the history. That is the reopen path, and it is recorded like any other
 * transition rather than being a special case in the store.
 *
 * `closed` has no outgoing edges. That is the whole of the terminality claim —
 * asserted here and, because a psql session can route around TypeScript, again
 * as a CHECK-shaped trigger in the migration.
