# Frame research beat v2 — tools, repos, workflows (all-out)

**Status:** FRAME RESEARCH · supersedes v1 landscape for completeness  
**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**How researched:** GitHub star-ranked discovery (`gh search` + direct `repos/` API) · last30days multi-source (Reddit/X/HN/GitHub/TikTok, Jul 2026 window) · prior domain archaeology · industry SDD comparisons  
**Program:** Order-route / DEX–CEX money-path harden  
**Parents:** Frame methodology · Spec v1 · domain inventory  

**v1 failure this fixes:** thin general lists without star-ranked repos, without last-30-days community signal, without financial-correctness (Jepsen/TigerBeetle-class) leverage, without clear “steal pattern vs install” decisions.

## 0 · Peace-of-mind verdict

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Did we miss the dominant 2026 professional agent stack? | **No longer.** Spec Kit (~125k★) · OpenSpec (~63k★) · BMAD (~51k★) are the live SDD triad; community actively rejects pure vibe coding for serious work. |
| Do we need to install all three? | **No.** Steal **patterns**; our Spec+Frame+doctrine already maps. Optional thin install only if agents thrash. |
| Highest *missed* correctness leverage? | **Jepsen-class thinking** + TigerBeetle **DST** (deterministic simulation) + property+fault combos — not another matching engine. |
| Highest *missed* network-fault leverage? | **Toxiproxy** (12k★) for trade↔matching timeouts (Tier B). |
| Replace our ledger with TigerBeetle/Formance? | **No** — doctrine owns ledger-client. **Study** their testing bar and transfer patterns. |
| Still vibe-coder risk? | Only if we ship without REQ→test→fresh verify and without assembled+chaos tiers. |

## 1 · Last 30 days (community) — what professionals are doing

**Engine run (2026-07):** multi-source corpus on “spec driven development / Spec Kit / OpenSpec / BMAD” (Reddit ~19 threads, X ~28, HN ~16, TikTok viral SDD clips, GitHub activity). Themes:

1. **“Stop vibe coding” is mainstream messaging** for serious agent work (X threads citing SDD / Spec Kit as the alternative to prompt-and-pray).  
2. **GitHub Spec Kit** framed as the default “constitution → specify → plan → tasks → implement” toolkit; star counts in community posts cited 90k+ (API now **~125k**).  
3. **r/SpecDrivenDevelopment + coding-agent communities + r/AI_Agents** are active discussion homes — SDD is a *community*, not a blog fad.  
4. **Brownfield preference:** independent comparisons (mid-2026) often rank **OpenSpec** high for delta/change management on existing codebases; **BMAD** for complex greenfield/enterprise with high ceremony cost; **Spec Kit** for team standardization + constitution.  
5. Community consensus we adopt: **plan before code**; agents fail fastest on fuzzy briefs; combine light exploration with hard Spec once design is clear.

**Implication for us:** Our Spec v1 + Frame method is **aligned with 2026 professional consensus**. Missing piece was not “another idea” — it was **enforcing** Spec as executable contract + chaos/DST-grade proof.

## 3 · What professionals do that vibe coders skip (workflows)

| # | Workflow | Source of practice | Our enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W1 | **Spec/constitution before code** | Spec Kit / OpenSpec / last30d community | Spec v1 REQ-IDs on every PR |
| W2 | **Delta specs for brownfield** | OpenSpec | Spec changelog + residual REQs |
| W3 | **Role-separated agents** | BMAD roles / doubt-driven | Builder ≠ Verifier ≠ Reviewer |
| W4 | **Property tests for invariants** | fast-check, TigerBeetle DST culture | Conservation, idempotency, concurrent place |
| W5 | **Fault injection against steady state** | Chaos principles, Jepsen bank tests | Spec F1–F8 as automated experiments |
| W6 | **Assembled path, not unit-only** | Walking skeleton, SRE PRR mindset | `platform:up` / slim compose CX-8 |
| W7 | **Network realism when needed** | Toxiproxy | Timeout between trade↔matching |
| W8 | **Static bans on second book** | Our scans + Semgrep pattern | Java custody + DAO mutator bans |
| W9 | **Worktree isolation** | Spec Kitty / our `pnpm wt` | Mandatory Build lanes |
| W10 | **Evidence or not done** | verification-before-completion | Fresh verify agent |

## 4 · Tier decisions (final for Plan)

### Tier A — start immediately (max delta / min ceremony)

1. **REQ-driven PR law** (Spec v1)  
2. **Chaos harness** implementing Spec F1–F8 (in-process + matching client faults first)  
3. **Assembled order-path script** on existing compose  
4. **Extend `vendor-shell-scan` + `custody-scan` (Java)**  
5. **fast-check** properties for hold/fill/idempotency/decimals  
6. **Fresh verify/review agents** every Class M  
7. **OpenSpec-style delta notes** when Spec amends  
8. **LIVE-LANES + worktrees**  

### Tier B — when Tier A hits a wall

| Tool | Trigger |
| --- | --- |
| **Toxiproxy** | Need real TCP timeout/partition trade↔matching |
| **testcontainers-node** | CI cannot depend on shared docker compose |
| **Spec Kit or OpenSpec CLI install** | Agents ignore Spec docs repeatedly |
| **Semgrep money rules** | Scan scripts unmaintainable |
| **Stryker mutation** | Want proof suite quality |
| **Chaos Toolkit YAML** | Want reusable experiment defs |
| **hftbacktest** | Seed/mm research only |

### Tier C — reject for this program

| Item | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Replace matching with exchange-core / HFT engines | Doctrine split already correct; latency non-goal |
| Replace ledger with TigerBeetle/Formance | Doctrine §0.6 ledger-client SoT |
| CCXT in money path | Floats + doctrine ban |
| Full BMAD install | Ceremony tax; steal roles only |
| Chaos Mesh / Litmus / Gremlin prod | No K8s go-live; blast radius wrong |
| Full Jepsen multi-node day-1 | Steal *tests design*; infra cost later |
| Pact platform day-1 | Monorepo + typed clients first |

---

## 5 · Steal-without-install playbook (highest leverage)

### From TigerBeetle / Jepsen

- Define **operations** (place, cancel, fill, redelivery) and **invariants** (conservation, no double spend).  
- Inject **faults** (crash, partition, redelivery) and **disprove** safety.  
- Prefer **deterministic simulation** of schedules over flaky sleep tests.  

### From Spec Kit

- Project **constitution** (we have it as law docs).  
- Force **specify → plan → tasks → implement** altitude.  

### From OpenSpec

- **Delta-only** changes for brownfield dual-book / chaos / seed slices.  
- Archive completed deltas into living Spec.  

### From BMAD

- Named adversarial roles as **fresh subagents**, not a 21-agent framework.  

### From Toxiproxy + our suite

- After unit chaos is green, inject **real** network failure between services.  

### From exchange-core

- Journal-before-process + snapshot cadence — **audit ours against** their model, don’t port Java.

## 6 · Mapping tools → Spec REQs (nothing orphaned)

| Spec cluster | Primary leverage |
| --- | --- |
| DB-* dual-book | Scan extend, Semgrep later, inventory scripts |
| CX-1–6 | Existing vitest (guard regressions) |
| CX-7–9 chaos/assemble/reconcile | Custom harness + Jepsen-inspired ops · platform:up · Toxiproxy B |
| DX-* | Vitest quote · Playwright only honesty |
| SD-* | Seeder resume · volume tests · optional hftbacktest study |
| RS-* scoreboard | Doc + WAVE-AUDIT |
| Process | Spec Kit/OpenSpec *patterns* · BMAD *roles* · doubt-driven |

## 7 · Explicit “we are not missing”

| Category | Covered? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026 SDD mega-repos | Yes | Spec Kit / OpenSpec / BMAD |
| last30days community | Yes | SDD vs vibe coding wave |
| Financial DB correctness culture | Yes | TigerBeetle + Jepsen |
| Chaos tooling spectrum | Yes | App → TCP → K8s tiers |
| Property testing | Yes | fast-check |
| Integration containers | Yes | testcontainers-node |
| Static money enforcement | Yes | scans + Semgrep path |
| Matching engines | Yes | study-not-replace |
| Exchange connectivity | Yes | CCXT ban confirmed |
| Mutation testing | Yes | Tier B Stryker |
| Agent worktrees | Yes | Spec Kitty pattern + our wt |
| Distributed testing curriculum | Yes | asatarin + maelstrom |

**Residual research debt (honest, small):**  
- One dedicated last30days pass on “Jepsen bank test / distributed ledger testing” for more community war stories (optional).  
- Deep read of Jepsen bank.clj patterns when implementing F5–F8 (Plan task, not Frame block).

## 8 · How this upgrades Plan (must include)

Plan **must** open with tooling spines:

1. **T0** — Chaos harness skeleton + F1–F4 green  
2. **T1** — Scan Java + mutator bans (dual-book tooling)  
3. **T2** — Assembled path runner doc+script  
4. **T3** — fast-check properties package  
5. Then product mountains (DB, seed, multi-asset…)  
6. Tier B hooks named as optional exit ramps
