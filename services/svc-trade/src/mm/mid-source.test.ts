 * Every double in this file used to omit that field, and that is how the discard
 * it hides survived here: a double that drops a required field cannot fail when
 * the code under test drops it too. `observedAt` is not optional in
 * `VenueBookSnapshot`, so a double without one describes an adapter that cannot
 * exist, and a test built on it proves nothing about the real path.
 *
 * Quantities are deliberately well clear of `DEFAULT_MIN_BEST_LEVEL_NOTIONAL`
 * rather than sitting exactly on it, so a test about symbol resolution or source
 * chaining does not quietly double as a test of the floor's boundary.
