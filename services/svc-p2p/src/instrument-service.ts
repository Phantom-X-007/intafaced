/**
 * PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS — storage, disclosure, and the record of both.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE ONE THING THIS FILE IS FOR
 *
 * A seller's account details are visible to exactly one person, for exactly as
 * long as that person has to pay them, and every look is on the record.
 *
 * Stated as the invariant the code actually implements:
 *
 *     An instrument is disclosed only while the escrow it is attached to is
 *     HELD — and a disclosure that is not logged cannot happen.
 *
 * "While the escrow is held" is `ESCROW_HOLDING_STATUSES` — `escrowed`,
 * `fiat_sent`, `disputed`. It is a better boundary than "while the trade
 * exists" in both directions:
 *
 *   · not at `created`, so a taker cannot harvest a seller's bank details in
 *     the two-minute window before the lock is even known to have posted;
 *   · not at `released` / `cancelled`, so a completed trade is not a permanent
 *     licence to read the account of someone you dealt with once.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * HOW "NOT LOGGED" IS MADE IMPOSSIBLE
 *
 * Not by discipline. The reveal is ONE statement, in which the SELECT of the
 * details is cross-joined to a data-modifying CTE that writes the access log.
 * The details row is only produced when the log row was produced. There is no
 * ordering of a crash, no early return, and no future edit to this file that
 * reads the details and forgets the log, because they are the same statement.
 *
 * The database holds up the other end: `instrument_access_log` has a BEFORE
 * UPDATE OR DELETE trigger that raises. The log cannot be tidied afterwards.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THERE ARE TWO COPIES OF THE DETAILS
 *
 * `payment_instruments.details` is the live one the owner maintains.
 * `trade_payment_instruments.details` is a snapshot frozen when the trade was
 * opened. The duplication is deliberate and it buys two things:
 *
 *   · the owner may edit or remove the live one at any time without breaking a
 *     trade whose buyer is halfway through a bank transfer;
 *   · **the destination cannot change mid-trade.** Show account A, let the
 *     buyer start paying, switch to account B, then truthfully report that
 *     nothing arrived — that is a scam that leaves a clean audit trail, and a
 *     live pointer instead of a snapshot is what makes it possible.
 *
 * The snapshot is not permanent: `purgeExpiredSnapshots()` wipes the values off
 * closed trades past the retention window and keeps the fingerprint, so an
 * appeal can still ask "was this the account the buyer was shown" without us
 * still holding the account.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Doctrine §0.6: there is no money in this file. An instrument is a
 * destination; the value is in svc-ledger and moves only through recipes.

 * WHERE A REFUSAL WAITS FOR A FREE CONNECTION.
 *
 * A refused take has to be written down (#805) and it has to survive the abort
 * that the refusal itself causes — so the row cannot be written on the caller's
 * transaction, which is the one being rolled back. The first fix wrote it on
 * `this.sql` instead. That is right about durability and wrong about
 * connections: `refuseTake` runs INSIDE `reserveTrade`'s transaction, that
 * transaction is holding a pool connection, and asking the same pool for a
 * second one is a request that only completes when somebody lets go.
 *
 * Nobody lets go. `DATABASE_POOL_MAX` defaults to 10, so ten concurrent refused
 * takes against ten DIFFERENT offers hold all ten connections and each queues
 * for an eleventh. The transactions then sit `idle in transaction` — no
 * statement is running, so `statement_timeout` cannot fire, and postgres.js's
 * own queue has no timeout at all. The service does not recover, and the ten
 * offer rows stay locked, so those offers die with it. Cost to the attacker:
 * ten `trades.take` calls naming a method the offers do not list. `methodAllowed`
 * is checked before the bounds check, so no funds, no valid amount, and no
 * instrument are required.
 *
 * So the row is neither written inside the transaction nor written while it is
 * open. It is COLLECTED here — a plain in-memory push, no connection — and
 * flushed by `duringTake` once the transaction has ended and handed its
 * connection back. Durable across the abort, and never contending for the pool
 * with the transaction it is describing.

   * Freeze the seller's destination onto a trade, inside the caller's
   * transaction.
   *
   * Called from `reserveTrade` — BEFORE any lock, alongside every other reason
   * a take can be refused. A seller who cannot be paid should not have their
   * asset escrowed against a payment the buyer has nowhere to send: that trade
   * can only end in a timeout or a dispute, and both of those cost the seller
   * fifteen minutes of locked balance to discover something knowable up front.
   *
   * Same transaction as the trade row, so a trade with no destination is not a
   * state that can be committed.
   *
   * THE METHOD ID IS KEYED, NOT COMPARED RAW. Every write path stores the id
   * through `normaliseMethodId`, so what is in this column is always lowercase.
   * The id arriving here is not: it is the taker's copy of a string the MAKER
   * typed into their offer's `methods`, which is stored verbatim. A maker who
   * declared `"Bank_Transfer"` therefore produced takes carrying
   * `Bank_Transfer`, which matched no row — and the seller was told they had no
   * destination for a method they were holding one for, on every single take of
   * that offer. Comparing raw here was the difference between an offer that
   * works and an offer that cannot be taken by anyone, decided by a capital
   * letter nobody was ever told mattered.

  /**
   * RUN A TAKE, AND WRITE DOWN ANY REFUSAL IT PRODUCED — AFTERWARDS.
   *
   * The flush point, and the only way to get a `DenialSink`. `refuseTake` needs
   * one and the compiler will not let you call it without one, so a refusal
   * cannot be raised outside a scope that ends by flushing it. That is the
   * property worth having: #805's guarantee ("a refused take is logged") is not
   * re-established by remembering to log at each throw site, it is
   * re-established by there being nowhere to throw from that is not wrapped.
   *
   * The `finally` runs after `run` has settled. When `run` is a
   * `transaction(…)`, settling means postgres.js has already issued the
   * ROLLBACK and returned the connection to the pool — so the INSERT below asks
   * for a connection the caller is no longer holding. That ordering is the
   * whole fix; see `DenialSink`.
   *
   * The row lands after the abort rather than before it, which moves the
   * crash window rather than closing it: a process that dies between the
   * rollback and the INSERT loses the row. It is the same best-effort contract
   * `logDenied` already documents, the window is microseconds of local work
   * with no I/O ordering in it, and the alternative on offer was a service that
   * stops answering after ten requests.

 * schema we cannot honour, and a listing that silently omitted the bad row would
 * hide the exact thing an operator needs to see. The refusal names the method
 * and country so the offending row can be found.
 *
 * The database enforces the structural half of the same rules — see
 * `payment_method_fields_are_well_formed` in
 * `drizzle/0001_p2p_payment_instruments.sql`. The two are not redundant: SQL can
