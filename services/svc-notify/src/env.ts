/**
 * svc-notify environment.
 *
 * Self-mounts /trpc, so it must authenticate the edge principal. No ledger
 * client, no INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET — this service never moves value and never
 * calls another service with a service credential.
 *
 * THE CHANNEL CREDENTIALS (§0.4)
 *
 * Email, push and SMS each reach the world through a gateway URL the owner
 * configures. Whoever answers that URL is the owner's choice and is named
 * nowhere in this repository: §0.7 keeps partner names out of shipped code, and
 * keeping the name out of the code is also what makes changing provider an env
 * change rather than a release.
 *
 * A channel with no URL is not "off". It is UNCONFIGURED, and it refuses every
 * message by name so the refusal is on the record — see `channels/gateway.ts`.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN, AND WHAT `NOTIFY_REQUIRED_CHANNELS` DOES
 *
 * An honest refusal is the right behaviour in dev and in test. In a deployment
 * that is supposed to be sending margin calls it is a silent outage with a good
 * paper trail — nobody reads a delivery table until somebody complains.
 *
 * So the operator states which channels this deployment depends on, and a
 * required channel with no credentials is FATAL AT BOOT. Same posture as
 * `EDGE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET` in `@intafaced/config`: no default, no fallback, the
 * process refuses to start. A notifier that cannot notify should page somebody
 * at deploy time, not at 3am through a borrower.
 *
 *   dev / test    unset means "nothing required". Frictionless: no gateway is
 *                 needed to run the suite or the local stack.
 *   staging/prod  unset is itself FATAL. The operator must write `none` to say
 *                 "in-app only, on purpose" — because "decided" and "never
 *                 thought about it" must not look the same in a config file.
 *
 * This variable does NOT decide which channels a product should use. That is the
 * owner's call, and inventing it here would be inventing product law. It only
 * makes the decision explicit and its absence loud.
