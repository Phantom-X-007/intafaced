/**
 * BROWSER ORIGINS — the door `apps/web` has been knocking on since it was built.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * svc-edge sent no CORS headers at all. Not a permissive set — none. There is no
 * `@fastify/cors`, and `apps/web/next.config.ts` declares no rewrite, so the
 * browser talked to `http://localhost:4000` from `http://localhost:3000` as a
 * genuine cross-origin call and refused every answer.
 *
 * That is not a partial outage. `edge-client.ts` attaches `Authorization:
 * Bearer …`, which is not a CORS-safelisted request header, so **every tRPC call
 * this app makes is preflighted** — and a preflight to a server with no CORS
 * layer reaches the catch-all proxy as a bare `OPTIONS`, which no upstream
 * answers usefully. The request never happened. The unauthenticated reads fare
 * no better: `GET /ready` is a simple request that is actually sent, but with no
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` on the reply the browser refuses to hand it to
 * JavaScript. That is the masthead's "PLATFORM UNREACHABLE" — the edge answered
 * 200 and the browser threw it away.
 *
 * So no browser call from `apps/web` to the edge has ever succeeded, and an
 * audit's conclusion follows: a fabricated landing page survived for weeks
 * because the real data path from that app had never worked in a browser. There
 * was nothing to compare a mock against.
 *
 * The vendored shell on `:8090` was never affected — nginx proxies its `/api`
 * same-origin, so no `Origin` header is sent and none of this applies to it.
 * Nothing in this file changes that path, and there is a test saying so.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE SHAPE, AND WHY EACH PART IS SHAPED THAT WAY
 *
 * **An allowlist from configuration, never a wildcard.** The origin we echo is
 * one we were told about; there is no code path that emits `*`. See the
 * credentials note below for why `*` is not merely lazy here but wrong.
 *
 * **No `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, deliberately.** Our front-ends carry
 * no ambient credential to send. `apps/web/src/lib/providers.tsx` holds the
 * access token in memory — explicitly not `localStorage`, explicitly not a
 * cookie — and `edge-client.ts` attaches it as an `Authorization` header, which
 * a browser sends because the script asked it to and not because the origin
 * matched. There is no `credentials: 'include'` anywhere in `apps/`. Announcing
 * credentials support would be describing a mechanism we do not use, and it
 * would tie our hands: a response carrying `Allow-Credentials: true` may never
 * carry `Allow-Origin: *`, so the two mistakes reinforce each other. We make
 * neither.
 *
 * The day the §13 refresh-token socket lands — `providers.tsx` names it: a
 * refresh token in an httpOnly cookie set by a route handler — this decision has
 * to be re-taken HERE, by someone reading this paragraph, and not inherited by
 * accident. A cookie would make every request in this file credentialed.
 *
 * **`OPTIONS` is terminated at the edge and never proxied.** Not "handled before
 * the proxy" — never proxied, on any path, from any origin. A preflight is
 * unauthenticated by necessity (the browser sends it before it will send the
 * `Authorization` header), so it is the one request in the platform that reaches
 * us with no principal and no token, and the only safe amount of it to forward
 * is zero. Two properties fall out:
 *
 *   · It cannot reach anything that mutates, because it cannot reach anything.
 *   · It cannot be used to probe which routes exist. The answer is computed from
 *     the `Origin` header alone, before `resolve()` is ever called, so a
 *     preflight to a real prefix and a preflight to an invented one are byte-for-
 *     byte identical. A CORS layer that 404'd unknown paths would hand any
 *     attacker the route table one guess at a time.
 *
 * **The headers go on refusals too.** A 404 from the route table, a 503 from the
 * operator kill-switch, a 502 from a dead upstream — all of them carry the
 * allow-origin header when the caller's origin is allowed. This is not
 * generosity. A refusal the browser discards is reported in devtools as a CORS
 * error, so during an incident the operator who killed a module would watch the
 * UI say "unreachable" instead of "switched off by the operator". The status
 * code is the message; it has to survive.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT CLOSED
 *
 *   · `/admin/*` is not a CORS surface. `apps/admin` reaches the edge only from
 *     its own server (`control-plane-client.ts` holds the operator token; the
 *     browser talks to that app's own Next route). Opening the operator control
 *     plane to a browser origin would put `admin:write` — and the ledger freeze —
 *     one XSS away from a page we do not control, to enable a call nobody makes.
 *   · `x-intafaced-*` is absent from the allowed request headers, so a browser
 *     will not even send the edge's own header vocabulary. `stripReserved` in
 *     `principal-exchange.ts` removes it regardless; this is the same rule
 *     enforced one layer earlier, where the caller can see it.
 *   · `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` is unset. Clients read bodies, not headers.
 *   · `DELETE`/`PUT`/`PATCH` are not allowed methods. The only such route in the
 *     fleet is svc-matching's cancel, and svc-matching is deliberately absent
 *     from the route table — so a browser cannot even ask.
 *   · `http://localhost:8090` (the vendored shell) is not in the dev defaults. It
 *     is served same-origin through nginx and needs no CORS; listing it would
 *     grant a cross-origin capability to something that already works without one.

 * THE DECISION: an enforced environment with no configured origins serves a
 * CLOSED DOOR. It does not refuse to boot.
 *
 * `assertScreeningConfigured` and `assertRailPosture` both refuse to start, and
 * this deliberately does not, because the failure they prevent is not the
 * failure here. An unscreened process is SILENTLY PERMISSIVE and DISHONEST: it
 * clears every region and reports that as "screened", and nothing downstream —
 * no log line, no dashboard, no call site — can tell that apart from a real
 * check that passed. A sandbox rail tells a user their money moved. Both lie,
 * and neither lie is visible from inside the process, so refusing to run is the
 * only way to make them visible at all.
 *
 * An unconfigured origin list is the opposite on both counts. It is SILENTLY
 * RESTRICTIVE — the door is shut, nobody is let through who should not be — and
 * it is not silent to the person affected: the browser refuses the response and
 * names the missing header in the console, which is about as loud as a diagnostic
 * gets. Nobody is told anything untrue.
 *
 * And the blast radius of refusing runs the wrong way. The edge is the front door
 * for the entire platform, including callers that need no CORS at all: the
 * vendored shell on `:8090` (same-origin through nginx), the CCXT REST contract,
 * every server-to-server integration, `/health` for the load balancer. Refusing
 * to boot over a browser-only convenience would take all of those down to fix a
 * problem none of them have — trading a partial outage for a total one.
 *
 * So: boot, serve nobody a cross-origin grant, and be loud about it. `index.ts`
 * logs this at ERROR in an enforced environment and puts it on `/ready`, so the
 * state is answerable from a probe rather than from someone's memory.
 *
 * A MISCONFIGURED list is the other case and it does refuse to boot — see
 * `parseOriginList`. Saying nothing is a closed door; saying something that is
