# Redundant vs port — old work vs Bizzan shell

**Type:** Chat B outcome · decision list for Nitro  
**Verified:** `origin/main` @ `d768d7c` (2026-08-03)  
**Inputs:** shell inventory + `apps/web` tree + commit themes since Stream A  
**Product rule:** shell = product · `apps/web` retired as product  

---

## Verdict (one breath)

| Pile | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| **KEEP** | Almost all Stream A / craft work **already on the Vue shell** — not wasted; keep improving there. |
| **PORT** | A **short list of patterns** from `apps/web` (how it talks to our live edge/WS) — re-express in the shell, not copy React files. |
| **DROP** | Treating `apps/web` as a second product; more Next terminal features; dual design systems. |

**Bottom line:** You did **not** build a huge throwaway product. The big pile is **already on Bizzan**. The small Next app has a few **live-wiring lessons** worth stealing, then ignore as product.

---

## 1 · KEEP (already on shell — do not redo / do not trash)

These landed under `vendor/coinexchange/05_Web_Front` (and related tooling). **This is your main work product.**

| Theme | Evidence (examples) | Why keep |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------- |
| **Honesty / empty ≠ error** | Depth, market list, UC money panes, OTC, CMS, activity, envelope, AFK invite/activity/envelope | Trust floor on real screens |
| **Account / withdraw / safe desk craft** | Waves A/B, withdraw net+receipt, fee disclosure, mobile sticky | Trader desk quality |
| **Order entry polish** | Validation + honest confirm | Money-adjacent UX |
| **Dual-book / plane honesty** | Account banners, CEX/DEX plane in `App.vue` | Product law visible in UI |
| **Desk tools** | Hotkeys, blotter tools, panel resize, watchlist density, CMDK, a11y/focus | Pro-trader bar |
| **Auth / login honesty** | Login a11y, AboutUs, partner honesty | Onboarding trust |
| **intafaced overlays** | Academy, Bank, Dex, Pay, Protocol, Chain, … + `NotBuilt` | Our modules inside shell |
| **Brand / tokens on shell** | `intafaced.css`, rebrand wave | Our look on product surface |
| **Proof harness** | `tooling/uiproof/*`, residual register | Prevents “green but lying” |
| **Shell deploy** | Dockerfile, nginx, :8090 (Denon) | Makes all of the above visible |

**Do not** rebuild these in Next. **Do** keep fixing/extending them on the shell.

## 2 · PORT (from `apps/web` → shell as *behavior*, not file copy)

`apps/web` is small (~58 tracked files under the app): landing + **one** `/trade` terminal wired to **our** TypeScript services. Shell already has chart/depth/exchange UI (including lightweight-charts + `DepthGraph.vue` + huge `Exchange.vue`). What Next still teaches is **how we wire to *our* bus**.

| # | What | Where it lives today | Port means | Priority |
| - | ---- | -------------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| **P1** | **Public trade tape** over `svc-ws` `channel=trades` (empty ≠ broken) | `live-tape.tsx`, `trade-transport.ts` (+ tests) | Same honesty on shell trade panel / exchange trades list | **High** if shell still Java-tape or quiet-fail |
| **P2** | **Depth stream controller** (snapshot + sequenced deltas, gap handling) | `depth-controller.ts`, `ws-transport.ts` (+ tests) | Align shell book with `svc-ws` semantics Denon built | **High** for live desk |
| **P3** | **Edge client habits** (typed REST to edge, no invent on failure) | `edge-client.ts`, `rest.ts`, `result.ts` | Vue API layer talks to **edge only**, same failure rules | **High** (pairs rewire) |
| **P4** | **Money as decimal strings** helper discipline | `money.ts` (+ tests) | Any display/input path on shell uses same rules (no float paint) | **Medium** |
| **P5** | **Plane copy from registry** (custody sentence from `MODULES`, not freehand) | `plane.ts` + plane-switch | Shell plane switch already exists; tighten copy/source so UI can’t drift from custody law | **Medium** |
| **P6** | **Account equity from live services** (honest empty) | `account-equity.tsx` | Shell balances panes already craft’d; ensure **source** is our edge/ledger not dead Java | **Medium** (rewire) |
| **P7** | **Order ticket “can’t fetch → don’t draw fake”** | `order-ticket.tsx`, terminal comments | Mirror rule on shell order entry | **Medium** |
| **P8** | **Blotter = mine vs tape = public** separation | blotter vs live-tape comments | Keep that product distinction clear on shell | **Low** if already clear |
| **P9** | **fabricated-money test helpers** | `testing/fabricated-money.ts` | Reuse idea in shell/ui tests so invent can’t regress | **Low** |

**Not a port (wrong shape):**  
- Copying React/Next components into Vue.  
- Moving `packages/ui` into the Vue app as the only design system (shell has its own CSS tokens).  
- Replacing shell `Exchange.vue` wholesale with the Next terminal layout unless you later choose a deliberate redesign.

**Denon preference:** charts → **TradingView** long-term; shell already has lightweight-charts — port chart *data honesty*, not a third chart stack this week.

## 3 · DROP (stop spending here)

| Item | Why drop |
| ---- | -------- |
| **`apps/web` as product / default demo** | Shell is product; dual surface caused the drift story |
| **New features only on Next terminal** | Diverges forever |
| **Rebuilding auth, OTC, CMS, activity in Next** | Shell already has full areas |
| **Parallel “sexy redesign” of whole exchange in Next** | Explicitly not the path |
| **Marketing invent money on landing** | Already fixed once (#416); don’t reintroduce in either app |
| **Treating Stream A shell commits as “redundant because Bizzan exists”** | Those commits **are** the Bizzan product layer |

**Repo fate of `apps/web` (recommended):**  
leave code on main for now (tests, edge examples) · **no product roadmap** · optional later delete or demote to internal sandbox. No decision needed beyond “not product.”

---

## 4 · Split that reduces anxiety

| Workstream | Redundant? | Action |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------ |
| ~49 commits of shell craft/honesty | **No** | KEEP + continue |
| Next terminal live WS/edge wiring | **Partially** | PORT patterns P1–P3 first |
| Next as second home for traders | **Yes** | DROP product role |
| Scaffolding Bizzan already had (login, many pages) | You didn’t invent those; you **civilized** them | KEEP civilization |

---

## 5 · Suggested order (after this doc)

1. **No more Next product work.**  
2. On shell FE board, pick **P1–P3** only when a screen is being rewired to edge/WS anyway (don’t boil ocean).  
3. Rest of FE board = craft/rewire/honesty on **existing** shell pages (Chat D).  
4. Landscape (Chat C): still optional; only if P-charts need TradingView path.

---

## 6 · Agent one-liner

```
KEEP shell craft. PORT apps/web live edge/WS honesty patterns into Vue when rewiring.
DROP apps/web as product. Do not rebuild shell features in Next.
```
