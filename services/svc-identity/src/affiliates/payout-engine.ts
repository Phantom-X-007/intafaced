/**
 * AFFILIATE / IB PAYOUT ENGINE — Slice C (TRK-ops.affiliates).
 *
 * The tree (referral-tree.ts), the attribution (commission.ts) and the durable
 * accrual rows (accrual-store.ts) already exist. This is the half that moves
 * value: durable accrual rows → ledger postings, fanned out across the tree.
 *
 * IT IS REFUSE-CLOSED ON THE RATE, AND THAT IS THE DELIVERABLE.
 *
 * DIRECTION §8 item 10 reserves `leader_share_bps` "and every other fee-share
 * rate"; item 6 reserves fee and revenue recipes. Affiliate commission tiers
 * are both. So this engine is complete in every part except the number it is
 * not allowed to choose, and it names that gap with a stable code rather than
 * seeding a rate. A seeded rate in source is indistinguishable from a decided
 * one three months later — see the deleted DEFAULT_ACCRUAL_TIERS (10/5/2%) in
 * commission.ts, which is exactly how an invented bps became platform default.
 *
 * §0.6 — NO VALUE MOVES OUTSIDE packages/ledger-client. This file assembles no
 * entries. It calls two existing recipes (`sweepFeesToRewards`, `rewardPay`)
 * and posts them. It adds no recipe and edits none: a new recipe is a
 * DIRECTION §3 owner carve-out.
