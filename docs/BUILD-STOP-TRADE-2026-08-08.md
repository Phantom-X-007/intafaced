# BUILD STOP — TRADE lane, 2026-08-08

Companion to [`TRADE-LANE-HARVEST-2026-08-08.md`](./TRADE-LANE-HARVEST-2026-08-08.md), which holds the full seven-mountain survey. This is the state of the lane and what is owed.

---

## 1 · The correction the lane turned on

The brief described all seven `trade.*` mountains as unbuilt. **Six were substantially built and merged.** The brief was written against a checkout **320 commits behind** `origin/main` — a tree where `svc-trade` had 78 TypeScript files instead of 123, 5 ADRs instead of 25, and where three of the five law documents it cited _by path_ did not exist.

So the lane's work became **finish, mount, repair** rather than build. Two of the largest items were code that existed, passed its tests, and was reachable from no route at all.

**Standing lesson:** re-derive tip before believing anything about this repo, including a brief that names files.

| **#1097** | The OTC desk let the **customer name the price it filled at** — `midPrice` was a required wire input under `trade:read`, flowing unvalidated into a fill against house market-maker inventory. A staked caller could quote 10 BTC at a mid of 1 and take the inventory. Mid is now server-sourced and refuses when it cannot source one. Also: settle minted fresh UUIDs per call, so a retry after a partial post placed a **second hold** with no release path — ids are now derived from the quote. |
| **#1098** | The **third funding double-charge** in one file (after #1034 and #1047). The ledger key ended in a loop counter, so a replay whose book had changed — or merely whose row order flipped — reached the ledger under unseen keys and posted again, while the idempotent margin applier recorded one charge. Ledger and `margin_current` diverged, which is the inverse of #1034.                                                                                                                         |

## 4 · The one thing I set out to do and did not

**The TWAP scheduler is not mounted, deliberately.**

`tickAllAlgos()` has zero callers, so a trader can create a TWAP, get a 201, watch it persist, and never receive a single child order. I built the scheduler (~30 lines on the existing job host, default OFF), and the adversarial pass came back **DO NOT MOUNT**. It was right, and #1107 is the safe half only.

Mounting it opens three money paths in _untouched_ code that nothing has ever exercised, because nothing has ever ticked:

1. **Pause→resume compresses the schedule into a burst.** `dueAt` is `startedAt + index × interval` and resume does not re-space, so every overdue slice fires back-to-back at the tick cadence. Measured against the real engine: a 10-slice, one-per-minute TWAP paused 20 minutes and resumed placed **9 slices in 8 seconds** — the opposite of what a TWAP is for. Any user can trigger it via `algo.resume`; any tick outage triggers it with no user at all.
2. **A failed child cancel leaves the parent active.** The status update sits after the per-child cancel loop, so one throw and the algo keeps placing.
3. **Cancel silently no-ops after a restart.** The parent flips to `cancelled` while every child stays live on the book, holding funds and still filling.

Plus: one bad market freezes every user's algo (the depth calls sit outside the try block, so one rejection aborts the whole sequential sweep — and hydration order is stable, so the same parent starves every other one, every second, forever), and `halt` is terminal while a momentarily one-sided book is enough to halt.

**(1) needs a ruling before code**, which is why this is here and not done: an overdue slice should either be **skipped** — the moment passed, and time-weighted means what it says — or **caught up slowly**. That changes how much of a user's order executes. The other three are engineering and follow the ruling.

## 6 · Named residuals, recorded not guessed

Each is written at the code site, not only here.

- **`socket.otc-mid-feed`** — `TRADE_OTC_MIDS` is a fixed price read once at boot with no observation time. A stale mid is the same economic hole as a caller-supplied one, needing patience instead of a wire field. **The variable must stay empty in production** until the source carries a timestamp and refuses on age. The max-age number is owner law.
- **`socket.algo-principal-durability`** — making a TWAP survive a restart means storing an authorisation grant that outlives the session that gave it. How long a schedule may carry the right to trade on someone's behalf is owner law; minting a principal from a stored `userId` is worse.
- **Copy fee-share cap race** — `settleFeeShare` reads, posts, re-reads and writes with no lock, so two concurrent fills both pass the cap and both pay. The ledger side is safe on business keys, which is the trap: it faithfully _records_ the over-payment. Needs a reserve-then-post restructure and an atomic store primitive **before any route reaches that class**.
- **Funding period membership** — the loader returns positions open _now_, not as of the period, so a position opened between a failed tick and its replay adds a leg. The victim is the payer's ledger-vs-margin divergence, not the new position. Needs a ruling on what a period's membership is.

## 7 · Not real, despite the record

**VWAP/POV is recorded as blocked on "no honest volume series". The series exists.** `spot/candles.ts` sums taker fills with seeded market-maker volume excluded on _both_ sides, live-computed per request, already served at `GET /api/v1/ohlcv/:symbol`.

The accurate statement is that it is **thin**, not absent — and the ADR blocks on market _maturity_, reserving that call to the owner. **Still do not build VWAP.** The honest next step is one read-only query measuring real non-seeded volume per market over 30 days, handed over as evidence.

## 8 · Method note, for whoever runs the next lane

Every PR here was reviewed by a fresh agent whose only instruction was to break the money path. It was worth it every time:

- On the OTC desk it found **a bug I had introduced** (a normalisation split that made unsettleable quotes), reproduced a pre-existing stranding bug I had not looked for, and named the staleness gap that became `socket.otc-mid-feed`.
- On the funding key it proved the fix killed **more** than I claimed (a bare row-order flip re-posted the entire plan), found the new failure mode I was most worried about and guarded it, and **corrected my description of the residual** — I had named the wrong victim, because I had looked at the ledger side and not the margin side.
- On the TWAP scheduler it said do not mount, and produced the measurement that settled it.

Two of those three changed what shipped. A self-scored money diff would have shipped all three as-is.

**Machine state:** `pnpm` is not installed on this machine — the repo declares `pnpm@10.25.0` and the binary is absent from `~/Library/pnpm` (only the store remains). Everything here ran through `npx -y pnpm@10.25.0`. Worth fixing properly rather than rediscovering.
