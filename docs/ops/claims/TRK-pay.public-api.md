## Done bar

- [ ] pnpm verify (or FE-VERIFY when available)
- [ ] Proof: fleet OR proof_missing: fleet-blocked (NO-FLEET)
- [ ] PR link

## Law

- Do not hand-edit docs/LIVE-LANES.md mid-wave (inside Denon open PRs).
- Do not invent money/depth. No Shehzad implement. No dual-edit Denon open files.
- No Class X PSP/card go-live. Step 3 = signed outbound webhooks + retry + failure dashboard only.

> Residual noted above (if any) is unchanged and still real — closing the claim closes the
> SLICE, not the mountain. Mountain state lives in `tooling/tracker/features.mjs`.
