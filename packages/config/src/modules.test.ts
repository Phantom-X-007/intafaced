/**
 * THE CUSTODY BOUNDARY IS ONLY ENFORCED WHERE THE SCANNER LOOKS.
 *
 * `tooling/ci/custody-scan.mjs` is what makes Doctrine §16.10 ("provably
 * non-custodial or it doesn't merge") true rather than aspirational. It walks
 * the Protocol Plane services and fails the build if any of them imports the
 * ledger's write surface.
 *
 * ── What this test used to guard, and why it changed ────────────────────────
 *
 * That list was once a HARDCODED ARRAY whose own comment claimed it "Mirrors
 * packages/config/src/modules.ts", with nothing checking that it did. A mirror
 * nobody checks is a mirror that drifts, and the drift was silent in the worst
 * direction: add a Protocol Plane service to `modules.ts`, forget the array,
 * and the new service is simply never scanned. It does not fail — it reports
 * clean, because a service the scanner never opens cannot produce a violation.
 *
 * The array is now gone. The scanner DERIVES the list from `modules.ts`, so
 * that drift is structurally impossible rather than merely tested for.
 *
 * ── What is still worth asserting ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The derivation is a REGEX OVER TYPESCRIPT SOURCE, because the scanner is a
 * `.mjs` script that runs before anything is built and cannot import a `.ts`
 * module. That is a real constraint, not a shortcut — but it means the parse
 * can silently disagree with the types it is parsing. Reformat a module entry,
 * add a field between `service:` and `planes:`, switch a quote style, and the
 * regex quietly matches fewer entries than exist.
 *
 * The failure mode is identical to the old one: fewer services walked, still a
 * green tick. So the guard moves rather than disappears — this asserts the
 * derivation AGREES WITH THE TYPED REGISTRY, and that the hardcoded array has
 * not come back.
