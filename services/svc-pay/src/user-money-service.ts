/**
 * USER MONEY IN AND OUT (§4.2 `deposit` / `withdraw`).
 *
 * `PayService` is about MERCHANT money — a third party pays a merchant, and we
 * clear and settle it. This is the other half: a USER's own balance entering and
 * leaving the book.
 *
 * WHY IT IS IN svc-pay. Value entering the book must come from a rail, value
 * leaving it goes out through one, and the `RailAdapter` interface, the registry
 * and the two v1 adapters are all here. The alternative was a second service
 * learning about rails, or a money path with no rail behind it — which is a
 * money path with nothing reconciliation can check it against.
 *
 * THE THREE RULES FROM `payment-service.ts` APPLY UNCHANGED.
 *
 * 1. Value moves only through a ledger recipe (Doctrine §0.6). This service
 *    holds no balance; it holds a row saying what was intended and how far it
 *    got.
 * 2. Idempotency keys are business keys. `deposit:<rail>:<railRef>` and
 *    `withdraw.*:<withdrawalId>:<attempt>`. Never a random uuid.
 * 3. The direction of the money decides the order of operations:
 *
 *      INBOUND  (deposit)  — the rail moved first, in the real world. We book
 *                            value we are told has already arrived, and the
 *                            claim is committed before the booking so a crash
 *                            leaves a resumable marker rather than an
 *                            unexplained ledger entry.
 *
 *      OUTBOUND (withdraw) — the LEDGER moves first. The user must be shown to
 *                            have the money, in a hold, before any of it is sent
 *                            somewhere irreversible.
 *
 * WHOSE FUNDS ARE STRANDED IF THIS CRASHES EXACTLY HERE — answered per branch,
 * at each branch, below. That question is the reason for every extra state in
 * these two state machines.

   *
   * Two phases, and the split is not ceremony:

   *   1. CLAIM. The `(rail, railRef)` row is inserted and committed. Nothing has

   * the marker that says so. `deposits_status_idx` exists so an operator can
   * list exactly those. Re-running with the same `(rail, railRef)` finds this
   * row, re-posts (the ledger key is identical, so it is a no-op if it already
   * landed) and finishes the job.
   *
   * IF IT CRASHES AFTER THE POST AND BEFORE THE UPDATE, nothing is stranded at
   * all: the user has their money and the row is one status behind. That is a
