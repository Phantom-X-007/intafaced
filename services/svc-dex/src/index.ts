/**
 * svc-dex — the Protocol Plane's front door (§8.6, §17.5).
 *
 * `custody-scan` fails the build if this service imports a ledger write recipe,
 * and its environment carries no `INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET`, so it could not
 * reach `ledger.post` even if an import slipped past the scanner. That is a
 * property of THIS PROCESS, not of a quote: the internal book is custodial
 * (`custodial: true`), unpublished `DEX_EXTERNAL_VENUES` is not a live
 * external venue, and ranking is not certified best execution.
 */

/**
 * WHERE PRICES COME FROM, WIRED — the §27 venue set.
 *
 * Three kinds of venue, one interface. `LiquiditySource`'s header states why
 * that matters: the internal book implements the same type as everyone else, so
 * the router has no notion of "ours" versus "theirs" and cannot quietly favour
 * us. svc-dex ranks on effective price alone.
 *
 *   · `intachain-clob`  — on-chain, self-custody. Attached only when CLOB fee
 *     knobs are explicit (S-I3). Default shipped config omits it rather than
 *     quoting 0 bps / 0 settlement.
 *   · `internal-book`   — our engine. Custodial, and disclosed as such.
 *   · external venues   — operator configuration, none by default.
