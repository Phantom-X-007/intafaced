/**
 * PAYMENT INSTRUMENTS — the shape, the rules, and none of the I/O (§6.2).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL
 *
 * svc-p2p could lock escrow, release it, refund it and adjudicate a dispute —
 * and a trade still could not complete, because at the moment the buyer has to
 * pay the seller there was nowhere to send the money. The escrow machinery was
 * real; the payment leg was a `method` string and a `terms` paragraph.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THE FIELDS ARE DATA AND NOT CODE
 *
 * What a payer needs in order to actually send money differs by method and by
 * country, and it is not our knowledge to invent. A hardcoded list of methods
 * with hardcoded field names would be this repo asserting, in code, what a
 * bank transfer requires in Nigeria or what a mobile-money handle looks like in
 * Kenya — assertions no one here is entitled to make, and which would be wrong
 * silently rather than loudly.
 *
 * So a **method schema** is an operator-supplied record: a method id, a country,
 * a display label, and the list of fields that method needs in that country.
 * This file validates instrument details *against* whatever schema the operator
 * registered. It contains no method, no bank, no country's requirements, and
 * shipping it seeds none — an operator with `admin:compliance` registers what a
 * market actually requires, and until they do, that market cannot be used.
 *
 * That refusal is the honest behaviour. The alternative — guessing a plausible
 * field list so the feature "works" — produces instruments that look complete
 * and cannot be paid.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE
 *
 * No money. An instrument is a destination, never a balance (Doctrine §0.6);
 * nothing in this file has an `Amount` and nothing in it can.

 * THE ONE REFUSAL A TAKE GETS WHEN THE PAYMENT METHOD IS THE PROBLEM.
 *
 * It is a constant, and every word of it is chosen for what it does NOT say.
 *
 * `attachToTrade` used to throw
 *   `The seller has no active "${methodId}" destination for ${fiatCurrency}`
 * and the router returned `err.message` verbatim as a `BAD_REQUEST`. The throw
 * sits inside the reserve transaction, so a failed take rolls back cleanly — no
 * trade row, no inventory decrement, no escrow, nothing to clean up — and
 * `logDenied` was not called on that path, so it wrote no access-log row.
 *
 * Each take attempt was therefore a **free, unlogged, self-describing
 * confirm/deny** for "does seller S hold an instrument for method M in currency
 * C", with `instruments.methods.list` handing any authenticated caller the
 * candidate list to enumerate against. It answered a question about someone
 * else's bank accounts, for nothing, and left no trace it had been asked.
 *
 * Two things close it, and they are the two the ADR names:
 *
 *   · this message, which does not distinguish "no such instrument" from any
 *     other reason the take could not name a destination — same code, same
 *     text, same shape;
 *   · the access-log row every such refusal now writes, so the attempt is
 *     attributable and lands in the OWNER's own access log, like every other
 *     read of instrument existence.
 *
 * OFFER-SIDE residual is closed by `methodsWithLiveDestination` / sell create
 * gate (see helpers below). Take still uses this one message so a method the
 * offer lists but the seller later removed stays indistinguishable from any
 * other refuse — the board simply stops advertising it.

 * *advertises* a method the seller cannot actually be paid on. A successful-
 * shape take that then returns `p2p.take_refused` means "listed but no
 * destination" — still an existence oracle, just one step later.
 *
 * The fix is on the board, not on the take:
 *   · a **sell** offer may only declare methods the maker has an active
 *     destination for in the offer's fiat;
 *   · the board / offer read surface only returns those methods that still have
 *     a live destination (removal after post drops the method from the board);
