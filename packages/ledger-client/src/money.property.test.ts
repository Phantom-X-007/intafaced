/**
 * THE MONEY PRIMITIVES, ARGUED WITH INSTEAD OF SAMPLED.
 *
 * `money.test.ts` is example-based and stays that way — it pins the cases a
 * human decided were interesting, and it reads as documentation. This file asks
 * a different question: not "does 0.1 + 0.2 work" but "is there ANY pair of
 * amounts for which it does not".
 *
 * Every property here is a claim the rest of the platform already relies on.
 * `proRata` is used for staking rewards and PPLNS payouts, and its doc comment
 * promises the shares "always sum back to exactly `total` — the ledger will not
 * accept anything less". That is a universally quantified statement about an
 * algorithm with a dust-distribution loop and a sort, and no fixed set of
 * examples can establish it. A counterexample here is money that was created or
 * destroyed by a rounding path.
 *
 * Scope: pure arithmetic in `money.ts`. No balance is touched, no recipe is
 * called, nothing moves. This is the layer everything above it assumes is right.
 */

/**
 * Amounts across the range the book actually holds.
 *
 * `numeric(38,18)` gives 20 integer digits, so the generator spans 10^20 scaled
 * units and both signs — deliberately including values far larger than any real
 * balance, because an invariant that only holds for small numbers is an
 * invariant waiting for a whale.

/**
 * Weights, INCLUDING zero ones. `proRata` refuses a non-positive *total*
 * weight, so the first entry is forced positive; every other entry may be `0n`.
 *
 * This generator used to start at `min: 1n`. A zero weight was outside the
 * search space, so no property here could ever be evaluated on one — and a zero
 * weight is exactly where `proRata` misallocated on a negative total, handing
 * dust to participants entitled to nothing. The gate was not weak; its input
 * domain was narrower than the function's, and a defect that lives in the gap
 * is invisible however many runs you do.
 *
 * A zero weight is not a contrived input either: an unstaked participant, a
 * miner with no accepted shares in the round, a follower with the position
 * closed — all of them arrive as `0n` and all of them are in the array.
 *
 * Zero is drawn as its OWN branch rather than as one value in a `min: 0n`
 * range. Widening the range to include it is not the same as generating it:
 * over 0…10^24 uniform, `0n` essentially never appears, and a suite that
 * "covers" zero weights without ever producing one is the original defect
 * wearing a fix. Measured — with the range-only version, reverting the
 * `proRata` sort left the zero-weight property GREEN. With this one it fails.
