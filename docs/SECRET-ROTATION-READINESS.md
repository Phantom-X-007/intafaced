# Secret rotation readiness (tip)

**Tracker:** D26-P3-05 · **Class:** Ops runbook + gates. **Not** Class X live rotation.  
**Date:** 2026-08-15 · **Lane:** `denon-d26-p3-05-rotation`

This is the **tip runbook**: what must be rotatable, in what order, and which gates prove a disclosed value cannot be reused. It does **not** rotate anything. **No secret value appears here** — names, files, and gate ids only.

**Do not treat this page as a rotation.** Generating, pasting, or deploying a replacement credential is an owner action (Class X). Agents stop at readiness.

**Leverage (Phase A IN):** `.env.example` shapes + existing owner-actions + existing gates. Do not invent a second vault, a second money book, or a new product SPA.

**Historical inventory (blast-radius map, 2026-08-03):** [`SECRET-ROTATION-READINESS-2026-08-03.md`](SECRET-ROTATION-READINESS-2026-08-03.md). That document remains the long form. This page is the operator order on tip.

**Wallet disclosed-literal half (do not edit):** [`OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md`](OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md) — A1 first, A2 is a **different** account, A3/A3b/A4 constraints. Cite it; never duplicate its values.

## 1 · What must be rotatable (by class)

Shapes live in `.env.example` and `packages/config` / `services/*/src/env.ts`. Compose wiring is asserted by `compose-secret-parity` (see §3).

### 1.1 · Edge principal

| Env name                | Role                                                                                                                                                               | Rotate with                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EDGE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET` | HMAC over the principal svc-edge forwards. Edge signs; mounting services verify. `z.string().min(32)`, **no schema default**. Compose `:?` refuses an unset stack. | **One** `.env` edit. Restart **all** consumers together (14 services on the 2026-08-03 map). Partial rotation → authenticated paths **401**. |

`.env.example` carries a `dev-only-*` placeholder so a clone boots locally. That placeholder is **not** a production value. A staging/prod host still running it is a disclosure — treat the five `dev-only-*` fleet placeholders as burned and follow §2.3 of the 2026-08-03 inventory. Confirm off-repo; do not paste the placeholder into this file as if it were evidence.

### 1.2 · Ledger / internal service secrets

| Env name                  | Role                                                                                                                   | Rotate with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET` | Shared secret on the internal money plane. svc-ledger verifies; callers send it. `z.string().min(32)`, **no default**. | One `.env` edit. Restart **all** callers + ledger together (10 services on the 2026-08-03 map). Partial rotation → `ledger.post` **401** while `/health` stays green. **Verify with a money path** (`pnpm order-path-smoke` or a small fill), not a health check. |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`       | Access-token HMAC. Identity mints; edge/ledger/ws verify. `z.string().min(32)`.                                        | Identity + edge + ledger + ws **together**. Every existing session dies; that is the design.                                                                                                                                                                      |

`INTERNAL_SERVICE_BODY_BIND` is not a secret. If it is `require` anywhere, set it everywhere before blaming a rotation 401 on the secret.

### 1.3 · Notify gateway tokens

Optional **until** the matching URL is set. `svc-notify` `superRefine`: a gateway URL with no token is an open relay and **fatal at boot**.

| Env name                     | Pair with                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `NOTIFY_EMAIL_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | `NOTIFY_EMAIL_GATEWAY_URL` |
| `NOTIFY_PUSH_GATEWAY_TOKEN`  | `NOTIFY_PUSH_GATEWAY_URL`  |
| `NOTIFY_SMS_GATEWAY_TOKEN`   | `NOTIFY_SMS_GATEWAY_URL`   |

Rotate token and vendor console together. Blast radius is notify only. Do not put a live token in `.env.example`.

### 1.4 · Wallet env keys (vendored `01_wallet_rpc` + pay crypto rail)

**A4 still holds:** do not deploy `01_wallet_rpc` against real value until the owner security review. Rotate **because git history disclosed the old values**, not because the module is in the compose fleet.

| Env name                                                    | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Proof the old disclosed value is refused                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ECT_WITHDRAW_WALLET_SECRET`                                | ECT withdrawal signing seed (`coin.withdraw-wallet`). **OWNER-ACTIONS A1 — do this first among wallet keys.** Not listed as a filled `.env.example` default; the module is not in `docker-compose.apps.yml`. | `EctWithdrawSecretConfig` refuses unset **and** refuses when SHA-256(env) matches the digest of the committed literal (digest in source, **not** the literal). See [`OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md`](OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md) A1 “Already done for you”. Width of that digest is also CI: `wallet-rpc-mainnet` rule **M11**. |
| Second ECT seed (A2)                                        | Different account in a deleted `main()`. **Rotating A1 does not cover A2.**                                                                                                                                  | Code path gone (`EctApi.main` deleted). No env var. Owner still sweeps the historical source account. Cite A2; do not recover the literal into git.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `WALLET_RPC_AUTH_TOKEN`                                     | Shared `/rpc/**` auth. Minimum 32 chars.                                                                                                                                                                     | `RpcSecurityConfig` + `wallet-rpc-auth` scan: a bootable module without the guard on its classpath fails CI. Unset or short token → service does not start.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `ETH_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` / `ETH_WITHDRAW_WALLET_PASSWORD`    | ETH-family keystore passwords.                                                                                                                                                                               | Commented in `.env.example` with **no properties default**. Read `docs/RUNBOOK-ETH-KEYSTORE-REENCRYPTION.md` before setting on an existing keystore (empty password → files stop decrypting).                                                                                                                                                  |
| `PAY_CRYPTO_HOT_WALLET_KEY` / `PAY_CRYPTO_DEPOSIT_MNEMONIC` | Optional live crypto rail (TypeScript pay). Unset ⇒ no live rail.                                                                                                                                            | Schema: `0x` + 64 hex for the key. **Never commit a mainnet hot key.** Compose/env parity covers the name once required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

ACT node RPC in a test `main()` (A3) is evidence, not a fleet env key. Owner decides if that node is ours. Cite A3; do not delete it as a “fix”.

## 2 · Order of rotation

Order is **blast radius of value**, then **auth plane**, then **money plane**, then **session**, then **outbound notify**, then **per-service**. Do not skip 1–2 because the Java modules are not in compose — disclosure is in git history, not in `docker ps`.

1. **Wallet disclosed keys (Class X, owner only)**
   - Check balances / sweep **before** issuing replacements ([`OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md`](OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md) A1 steps 1–2).
   - Rotate **A1** `ECT_WITHDRAW_WALLET_SECRET` first among wallet secrets.
   - Treat **A2** as a separate burned account.
   - Then `WALLET_RPC_AUTH_TOKEN` (and ETH keystore passwords only if those modules will ever boot).
   - Keep `coin.rpc` off cleartext or off the public network (A1 step 5) or the new seed is disclosed on first use.
   - **Do not boot `01_wallet_rpc` to “test” the new key against real value (A4).**
2. **`EDGE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET`** — whole edge-principal set, one restart.
3. **`INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET`** — whole ledger-caller set, money-path probe.
4. **`JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`** — identity + edge + ledger + ws together.
5. **Notify gateway tokens** — with vendor-side token, URL pairing intact.
6. **Per-service pay webhooks** (`PAY_CRYPTO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `PAY_CARD_SANDBOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) and, only if the live rail is actually on, `PAY_CRYPTO_*` signing material.

Shared HMAC secrets have **no two-key overlap** today. The safe procedure is still: one env edit, restart the **entire** affected set. Rolling one container at a time is a mixed fleet.

A rotation **recreates containers**. That is why compose/schema parity is a rotation gate, not a nicety: every latent missing `environment:` line becomes a crash-loop at the same moment (§2.4 of the 2026-08-03 inventory; #431 ledger JWT, #442 academy internal secret).

## 3 · How gates prove the old disclosed value is refused

CI does not rotate. It proves **the code path cannot quietly reuse a known-bad or unwired secret**. Live “did the coins move” is still the owner’s chain check.

| Gate / guard                                                                                                | What a green line actually means                                                                                                                                                               | What it does **not** mean                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EctWithdrawSecretConfig` + [`OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md`](OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md) A1 | ECT will not start if `ECT_WITHDRAW_WALLET_SECRET` is unset **or** hashes to the disclosed digest. Copying the old literal out of git history to “make it boot” is blocked.                    | The on-chain account has been swept. History is still disclosed; only a new address makes the old key worthless. |
| `wallet-rpc-mainnet` **M11**                                                                                | The digest constant is 64 lowercase hex digits. A truncated digest would fail **open** (equals never matches).                                                                                 | Rotation happened.                                                                                               |
| `wallet-rpc-auth` (`RpcSecurityConfig`)                                                                     | Every bootable wallet RPC module has the auth guard on its classpath; `rpc.auth-token` is not an unread placeholder. Unset / short `WALLET_RPC_AUTH_TOKEN` → no start.                         | The token in a real deployment is unique.                                                                        |
| `secret-scan`                                                                                               | Credential-shaped **literals** in HEAD fail (except a **KNOWN_DISCLOSED** register that must stay true). Mutation suite (`secret-scan-mutation`) proves the scanner is not `exit 0` on line 1. | A value only in git history is gone.                                                                             |
| `compose-secret-parity`                                                                                     | Every **required** secret-shaped env field in `services/*/src/env.ts` is passed in that service’s `docker-compose.apps.yml` block. Rotation cannot leave a consumer unwired.                   | The **value** in `.env` is not `dev-only-*`. The check never reads values.                                       |
| `secrets` / gitleaks (when run)                                                                             | No new secret **landed in this tree**.                                                                                                                                                         | Owner vault contents.                                                                                            |

**Empty denominator:** if this runbook file is deleted, `secret-rotation-readiness` fails. A missing inventory is not “nothing to rotate”.

---

## 4 · Operator checklist (still not a rotation)

1. Confirm you are the human with wallet / vendor / vault authority. If not, stop.
2. Follow §2 order. Generate replacements **off this repository**. Never commit them.
3. After each shared-secret step: full affected restart, then the probe in the table (login / money path / notify).
4. For A1: verify the **old address** holds nothing. `pnpm scan:secrets` going quiet is **not** that proof.
5. Leave `01_wallet_rpc` undeployed until A4 is an owner decision.

## 5 · Files this mountain does not own

Do not “helpfully” edit: `docs/OWNER-ACTIONS-WALLET-RPC-SECRETS.md`, P3-02 threat docs, P3-10 incident runbook, P2-02 Java map, P4-07 ADR, `packages/config/src/screening.ts`, skip-honesty scans, `services/svc-edge`. Vue is HUMAN (`nitro-frontend-all`).
