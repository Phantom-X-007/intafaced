/**
 * TOKEN LAUNCH POLICY — what INTAFACED will put its name on (§8.4).
 *
 * `TokenFactory.sol` is permissionless and enforces only the bounds that keep a
 * token usable at all. This file is the platform's own, stricter opinion, and
 * the split is deliberate:
 *
 *   · the CONTRACT bounds are permanent and apply to everyone, including
 *     callers who never touch this API. They cannot encode platform policy,
 *     because policy changes and immutable code does not.
 *   · these bounds are the SURFACE's. Refusing here refuses a launch through
 *     INTAFACED. It does not, and must not, stop anyone deploying the same
 *     template themselves — that is what §22 means on this plane.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * NO MONEY IN A `number`
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `totalSupply` arrives as a DECIMAL STRING of whole tokens ("1000000",
 * "21000000.5") and becomes a scaled `bigint` here and nowhere else. It is
 * never a JS number at any point, not even briefly for validation — 1e21 is
 * already past `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, so a supply that looked fine in a
 * form would arrive on chain rounded, and the token would be permanently wrong
 * with no way to correct it.

 * point past which the amount stops being representable in the Fiat Plane's
 * `numeric(38,18)`, which is 20 integer digits and 18 fractional. A token whose
 * supply cannot be written down in the ledger cannot be listed, quoted,
 * escrowed or reconciled by anything on the other plane, and discovering that
 * after launch means telling a creator their immutable token is unlistable.
 *
 * PRODUCT DECISION, FLAGGED: this forecloses meme supplies above 10^20 whole
 * units. It is the conservative choice — a creator who is refused can pick a
 * smaller supply, whereas a creator who is allowed through has no recourse at
 * all, ever. If the owner wants larger supplies on a protocol-plane-only basis,
 * widening this constant is a deliberate decision that also needs the listing
 * path to refuse those tokens instead.
