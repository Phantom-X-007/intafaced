# Frontend master plan — Waves A / B / C + styleboard

**Status:** **LOCKED v3.1** · Nitro approved N1–N7 (2026-07-31) · free-hands override active  
**Tip base at lock:** `94c0a3f` — re-derive at implement  
**Spine:** methodology **v3.1**  
**Code:** none until **go implement**

**Nitro free-hands (binding):** Prior frontend work is **not a constraint**. Inventory tip so we don’t _accidentally_ ignore useful machinery; then choose rebuild, replace, or keep **only** if it serves world-class quality. Claude’s “already shipped → gap-fill only” is **advice on cost**, not a ban on redesign.

**Still true:** withdraw “you will receive” math + bare Confirm span are **live defects** worth fixing early either way.

## 3 · Wave A — Honesty (v3.1 order)

**Every slice starts with inventory:** read tip file → list what exists → then choose **rebuild / replace / keep** for world-class quality. Inventory prevents blind ignore of useful machinery; it does **not** force “delta only.”

### Already shipped at tip — do **not** rebuild **[VERIFIED 94c0a3f]**

| Area              | Present                                                                                           |

### A0 — Boot + Orca + baseline scorecard

Proof pack. **A0.5** fold: chart **tradingview.com** attribution link (one-hour compliance; kline has none).

### A2′ — Withdraw first (only confirmed live incorrectness)

### A1′ — One honesty vocabulary + true zero-coverage

1. Canonical vocabulary on styleboard artifact 3 (can draft words in Wave A docs if board not built).
2. Keep IxState on intafaced.
3. Shared uc component for `ix-empty*` speaking REASON words.
4. **Zero-coverage first:** Account.vue, Safe.vue, myorder.vue, then WithdrawAddress, EntrustHistory, growth screens as listed in Claude §D.3.
5. **Do not** rewrite MoneyIndex/Record that already have dialect 2 for “IxState purity.”

### A-x1 — Cross-surface number agreement

Terminal rail balance vs `uc/money` — identical or labeled different books. Dim 21.

### A-x2 / A-x3 — Submit locks + session expiry

Every irreversible action: lock. Ticket + withdraw + address-add + cancel + OTC release. Session death mid-flow = honest state. Gates 18.

### A3′ — Ticket **gap-fill only**

After gap-audit: only missing pieces (e.g. richer fee source honesty). Do not re-implement confirm/fee/click.

### A4′ — Book **gap-fill**

Grouping **genuinely missing** (`bookMode` all/bids/asks only). Click-to-price **exists**. DepthGraph first. Pattern: mihailgaberov study.

### A7′ — Plane/feed **gap-fill**

Much shipped #240. Delta only.

### A-x4 / A-x5 — Precision sweep + fee source honesty on withdraw-class surfaces

### A6 — LWC v5 written plan

**Background / non-blocking.** Not a peer of A2′.

### Wave A DoD

Gap-audit on every PR · gates pass on touched money · Orca · non-implementer on A2′/A1′/A-x* · no fixture-seeded balances · no rebuild of shipped ticket/book controls

### Wave B DoD

Nitro visual yes on desk+money · before/after crops · gates still green · baseline improved on targeted dims

## 6 · Wave C — Backend / heavy power

Full keyboard map · LWC v5 + RSI/MACD panes · indicator suite after golden tests · saved layout/widget canvas · multi-market · drag-reprice if API · DOM ladder · tape advanced · price alerts · API trust page

**Never:** social feed, leaderboards, confetti, AI-trades homepage

| **Admin-0** | Inventory: which is live — `04_Web_Admin` vs `apps/admin` vs both · ports · who logs in · Orca proof if up              |
| **Admin-1** | Honesty on money-ops screens: approve withdraw, freezes, kill-switch — no silent success, review receipts, submit locks |
| **Admin-2** | Apply **same styleboard tokens** as trader (one company face)                                                           |

**Do not start Admin-1 code until:** trader Wave A has landed withdraw+money honesty proof **or** Nitro explicitly says run admin in parallel.

| **7** | Admin product in this program?      | **In as Wave Admin** (Nitro + Grok 2026-07-31) — sequenced after trader Wave A foundation; not vibed |

### Admin — Wave Admin (planned track, not vibe)

**What it is:** staff back-office (approve withdrawals, users, fees, kill-switches) — **not** the trader desk.  
**Two surfaces on disk:** legacy `vendor/…/04_Web_Admin` · modern `apps/admin` (kill-switch, ledger freeze, jurisdiction). **First Admin step = pick which is live SoT** (inventory + Denon if unclear) — do not double-build.

| Rule                  | Meaning                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Same program**      | Same methodology, styleboard tokens, honesty gates, Orca proof                                                                         |
| **Sequence**          | After trader **Wave A foundation** (withdraw + money honesty + desk gates green enough to not thrash focus). Styleboard may be shared. |
| **Parallel OK later** | Separate worktree + LIVE-LANES claim; never same agent as `Exchange.vue`                                                               |
| **Territory**         | Not classic Stream A paths — open as `feat/admin-*` or agreed prefix; spine/money still Denon                                          |
| **Bar**               | Higher blast radius: irreversible staff actions need review receipt + real buttons + locks (same as withdraw bar)                      |

### Free-hands override (plain)

Agents **may rebuild** the trader UI from a clean visual/honesty system. Old orange patches and “already honest” screens do **not** force minimum-diff polish. Reuse only when it clearly helps quality.

## 12 · First implement paste (after go implement)

```
Wave A only. Tip worktree origin/main. LIVE-LANES.
Law: methodology v3.1 + plan v3.1 + Design Bar free-hands.
Prior UI is inventory only — not a ceiling. Rebuild allowed; reuse only if quality-true.
Inventory tip each slice, then best path (not minimum delta theater).
Prefer early: withdraw math+receipt+real Confirm; money honesty; desk honesty gates.
Auth fixture: real session only; NEVER seed balances.
Mass retheme waits for styleboard pick unless waiver. No Stream B. No fake numbers.
```
