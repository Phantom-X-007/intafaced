/**
 * Flag state, as an operator needs to read it.
 *
 * `resolveAll()` answers "is it on?". It does not answer "why?", and on a
 * kill-switch board the second question is the one that matters — an operator
 * who cannot tell an env override from a drop default will flip the wrong
 * thing. Everything below DERIVES the answer by re-asking the real
 * `isEnabled()` with narrowed contexts. No resolution logic is reimplemented
 * here, and no flag is listed here that is not in `FLAG_REGISTRY`.
 *
 * ── The third question, and why this file changed ───────────────────────────
 *
 * "Is it on?" and "why?" were both answered, and the board was still wrong,
 * because it never asked **"does this state describe the platform?"**.
 *
 * No file under `services/*` resolves a flag. So `resolveAll()` returned
 * `protocol.amm: false` at the default `LAUNCH_DROP=0`, the board rendered
 * that as a `Dark` chip next to a switch, and the AMM procedures answered
 * every request anyway. An operator reading this console believed a capability
 * was off. It was serving.
 *
 * `ControlEffect` is that third answer, and the board renders it beside every
 * state. A row whose effect is `none` is a launch-plan entry: it gets no chip
 * that could be read as "this capability is off", and its switch is disabled —
 * a control that moves and does nothing is the exact failure found here.
