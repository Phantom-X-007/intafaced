/**
 * LATENCY GRADING — the vocabulary (§27:760, D-S-18).
 *
 * The machinery that produces these lives in `@intafaced/venue-adapter`
 * (`fabric/latency.ts`). Only the types live here, for the reason this package's
 * header gives: `MarketDataAdapter` is declared here, and an adapter cannot
 * offer its own grade through an interface that has no word for one.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT IS MEASURED, EXACTLY — AND WHAT IS NOT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `LatencyMeasurement` is a union of ONE on purpose. "Latency" is three
 * different numbers that differ by orders of magnitude, and a grade that does
 * not say which one it holds is a number a consumer will read as whichever one
 * it wanted:
 *
 *   · **`rest-round-trip`** — what we actually measure. Wall-clock on OUR clock,
 *     from immediately before the HTTP request leaves to the moment the response
 *     body has been received. It includes network flight time both ways, the
 *     venue's own service time, and TLS/socket work the client library does per
 *     call.
 *
 * It does **NOT** measure, and must never be read as:
 *
 *   · **Stream delivery lag** — how long a depth delta takes to reach us over
 *     the WebSocket. A venue can serve REST snapshots quickly and deliver its
 *     stream late; that is a different failure with a different cause.
 *   · **Book staleness** — how old the book was when we read it. That is
 *     `observedAt` on the snapshot (see `book.ts`), and #1163 settled that
 *     `observedAt` is when a quote was OBSERVED, not when it was read. A fast
 *     round-trip returning a stale book is fast and wrong.
 *   · **Venue-side matching latency** — what happens to an order after it is
 *     accepted. Nothing in this package measures that, because the trading half
 *     of every adapter is deliberately not built (`adapter.ts`).
 *   · **Time spent waiting on our own rate-limit governor.** A request the
 *     governor refuses is never timed at all. This is deliberate: charging a
 *     venue for a delay WE imposed would make our own throttling look like the
 *     venue degrading, and the grade would then argue for routing away from a
 *     venue that did nothing wrong.
 *
 * Adding a second measurement means adding a member to this union, which makes
 * every consumer's `switch` fail to compile until it decides what to do — the
 * opposite of silently changing what an existing number means.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * `grade: null` — AN UNGRADED ADAPTER IS NOT A BAD ADAPTER
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `docs/adr/2026-08-04-predict-quant-connect-law.md` (D-S-18, Accepted) states
 * the rule this file exists to make representable:
 *
 *   *"A score for an adapter that has not run is not a low score — it is no
 *   score, and an unscored adapter must not receive routing weight. This is the
 *   same defect class as a scan that walks zero files and prints clean."*
 *
 * So an adapter with no observations has `grade: null`, and `null` is the
 * fabric's existing word for "refused to answer" — an empty venue, an unknown
 * id, an unmapped market and an empty book all return `null` already. A missing
 * measurement follows the same convention rather than inventing a new one.
 *
 * `'F'` would have been the easy choice and it is wrong in BOTH directions:
 *
 *   · It is indistinguishable from a venue we measured and found appalling. An
 *     operator reading `F` cannot tell "this venue times out" from "nobody has
 *     ever called this venue", and those demand opposite responses — one is a
 *     venue problem, the other is a wiring problem on our side.
 *   · It is a claim. We would be asserting a measured property of a venue we
 *     have never spoken to, which is precisely the fabrication the rest of this
 *     package refuses.
 *
 * Every derived statistic is `null` under the same rule. A zero reject rate on
 * zero samples reads as "never refused us once", which is a perfect score
 * awarded for silence.
 *
 * NOTE THE ASYMMETRY, because it is the safety property: ungraded is not a bad
 * grade, but it is also NOT permission to route. D-S-18's second clause — "an
 * unscored adapter must not receive routing weight" — means the consumer must
 * treat `null` as "not eligible", not as "no news is good news". `null` is
 * unrankable, and `isGraded` exists so a consumer cannot accidentally rank on it:
 * the letter is unreachable without passing the check.
