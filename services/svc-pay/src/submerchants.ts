/**
 * THE SUB-MERCHANT TREE, AND WHO MAY ACT INSIDE IT (§6.1 PayFac mode).
 *
 * ══ WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DECIDE ═══════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * IT DOES NOT MOVE VALUE, AND IT NEVER WILL. There is no `ledger` import here,
 * no recipe, no balance, and no amount of any kind. A sub-merchant IS a
 * sovereign account exactly as a merchant is, its money sits in the ledger, and
 * it moves only through `packages/ledger-client` (Doctrine §0.6). What this file
 * decides is WHO MAY ASK — never where value is or where it goes.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT MAKE US A PAYMENT FACILITATOR. `docs/SPEC-PAY-VERTICALS-2026-08-02.md`
 * §2 is explicit — "Build: the mechanics. Do not become one" — because a payfac
 * takes on its sub-merchants' liability, which is a licence and a sponsor bank,
 * not a feature flag. Accordingly `settlingParty` accepts exactly one value here
 * (`'self'`, which is what settlement already does) and refuses every other by
 * name. See `SETTLING_PARTY_SELF`.
 *
 * ══ THE "14 PERMISSION AREAS" — SAID OUT LOUD ════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The tracker row `pay.payfac` is titled "PayFac mode — sub-merchant trees, 14
 * permission areas". THAT LIST HAS NEVER EXISTED. The phrase appears in
 * `tooling/tracker/features.mjs`, `tooling/coverage.yaml`,
 * `INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md` and three board renders derived from them —
 * six copies of one title string, and nobody ever enumerated the fourteen.
 * `docs/PAY-LANE-HARVEST-AND-BUILD-PLAN-2026-08-08.md` §2 records the same
 * finding independently, and §6.3 puts "enumerate them, or drop the claim from
 * the title" on the owner's list.
 *
 * So this ships the MECHANISM, and the default area list below is EVERY AREA
 * THAT NAMES A SURFACE THIS SERVICE ACTUALLY HAS — eleven of them, not fourteen.
 * Padding the list to hit a number in a title would be inventing product law
 * inside an implementation, which is the one thing an agent may not do. Adding
 * the twelfth is a one-line change to `PERMISSION_AREAS` and needs no migration,
 * because `area` is stored as text precisely so an unsettled list is not frozen
 * into a live table.
 *
 * ══ THE TWO CHECKS, WHICH ARE NOT THE SAME CHECK ═════════════════════════════
 *
 * Every operation names a SUBJECT merchant and is judged twice:
 *
 *   1. SCOPE — structural, absolute, and unwidenable by any configuration. The
 *      actor's merchant node must be an ancestor of the subject, or the subject
 *      itself. Nothing else is reachable, ever. This is what makes "a parent
 *      cannot read a sibling subtree" a property of the system rather than a
 *      promise, and no grant can turn it off.
 *
 *   2. AREA — a permission, and only for a subject that is not the actor itself.
 *      A merchant holds every area over its OWN node (that is what owning your
 *      merchant means). Over a descendant it holds an area only if it is the
 *      ROOT of that tree, or a live grant says so.
 *
 * WHY THE ROOT HOLDS EVERYTHING IMPLICITLY. Some node has to be the source of
 * authority or the first grant can never be made, and the root is the only
 * defensible one: it is the node with the platform relationship, and §2 of the
 * spec says the facilitator "takes on their liability". Giving that to an
 * operator scope instead would mean a payfac cannot onboard anyone without a
 * human at this company clicking, which is not a payfac.
 *
 * WHY A NON-ROOT CANNOT SELF-GRANT. Delegation only ever flows DOWN, and only
 * what the granter already holds. An intermediate node with `submerchant` over
 * its children cannot hand itself `refund`; if it could, the grant mechanism
 * would be decorative and the tree would collapse back into "every node owns its
 * whole subtree".
