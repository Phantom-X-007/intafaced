/**
 * MONEY-PATH SKIP INVENTORY — D26-P2-13 register.
 *
 * Every money-path test file that can decline to run must appear here with a
 * kind and a reason, or the skip must be deleted. The companion gate
 * (`money-skip-honesty-scan.mjs`) fails in both directions:
 *
 *   · a new skip under a money root that is not listed → red (register or delete)
 *   · a listed file that no longer skips / no longer exists → red (delete the row)
 *
 * This is not a licence to skip. It is the permanent ledger of which money
 * suites are allowed to be absent from a local run, so a silent grow cannot
 * look like coverage.
 *
 * Kind meanings:
 *   · infra-journalled — skip is gated by a shared CI-aware probe that journals
 *     (`postgresAvailable` / `recordInfraProbe` / `devChainReachable`)
 *   · private-probe    — still decides on a hand-rolled connection; also owed
 *     to `unreported-suites.mjs` PRIVATE_PROBE until fixed
 *   · pending          — hard `it.skip` / `test.skip` for unfinished work
 *   · opaque           — skips by some other shape; must name what lifts it
 *
 * 2026-08-15 hunt (D26-P2-13): money roots had 0 hard `it.skip` / `xit` /
 * `test.todo` / `this.skip`. Every current skip is journalled (`postgresAvailable`
 * / `recordInfraProbe`). The pay EVM live rail still skips without a node — it
 * journals; it is not gone. Do not invent pending rows to look busy.
