/**
 * EXTERNAL VENUES — the §27 `MarketDataAdapter`, ours, credential-free.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THERE IS NO `ccxt` IMPORT IN THIS FILE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * §27, INTAFACED CONNECT: _"Our own CCXT-class layer, built past it: typed,
 * streaming-first, latency-graded… **No third-party connectivity library in the
 * money path** — Doctrine 5 applies (own tech, narrow interfaces, Rust-portable
 * hot paths)."_
 *
 * So the `ccxt` package is not a dependency of this workspace, and that is a
 * decision rather than an oversight. Two reasons, and the second is the one that
 * would actually cost a user money:
 *
 *   1. **Doctrine 5 / §27.** The connectivity layer is ours. `packages/
 *      exchange-contract` already serves a CCXT-SHAPED API outward so every bot
 *      and terminal can trade on us; `packages/venue-adapter` is the inward
 *      half. Neither needs their code to keep their shape.
 *   2. **CCXT's unified `fetchOrderBook` returns JavaScript numbers.** Every
 *      venue below publishes its book as decimal STRINGS; CCXT parses them into
 *      floats before a caller ever sees them. Routing through it would put a
 *      float in front of every price in the platform — the one thing Doctrine
 *      forbids without exception, and unrecoverable once it has happened.
 *      Reading the venue's own strings costs one adapter and keeps the
 *      eighteenth decimal place.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * CONFIGURED, NOT HARDCODED
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * No venue is named in this file. A venue is a row of configuration
 * (`DEX_EXTERNAL_VENUES`), which buys three things:
 *
 *   · Doctrine §0.4 — adapters, not integrations. Adding a venue is config, and
 *     the platform never depends on any of them to function.
 *   · Doctrine §0.7 — no partner or vendor name in shipped code or user-facing copy.
 *   · An operator can add, reweight or drop a venue without a deploy, which is
 *     what a latency-graded fabric needs to be able to do.
 *
 * **The default set is empty.** A service that had no outbound network egress
 * yesterday does not silently acquire it. An operator opts in per venue.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * CREDENTIALS: NOT NEEDED HERE, AND REFUSED NEXT DOOR
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Public depth needs no key on any tier-one venue, so the quote path works today
 * with nothing issued. Execution is the opposite: it needs trade-scoped Venue
 * Vault credentials (§27) and an OMS (§28, `svc-execution`), and neither exists.
 * `MarketDataSource.submit()` therefore throws `VenueExecutionRefused` rather
 * than returning a plausible rejection — see the argument there.
 *
 * ── What is NOT built, named rather than implied ────────────────────────────
 *
 * · **No rate-limit governor.** §27 asks for one per venue. This adapter fetches
 *   on every quote, so a busy market will hit a public endpoint hard enough to
 *   be throttled or banned. A venue that starts answering 429 degrades to
 *   `unreachable` and is dropped from routing rather than serving a bad price —
 *   correct, but it is a degradation, not a governor.
 * · **No WS streaming, no sequenced/gap-detected books.** §27 asks for
 *   WS-first. This is REST polling. `packages/market-data` already has the
 *   sequence machinery (`applyDelta` refuses a gap); wiring it needs a stream.
 * · **No cross-venue latency weighting.** `health()` records round-trip per
 *   venue, so the input exists; nothing consumes it as a routing weight yet.
