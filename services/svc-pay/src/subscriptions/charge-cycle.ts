/**
 * THE RECURRING CHARGE CYCLE — schedule, due, attempt, outcome. Pure law.
 *
 * No I/O, no clock of its own, no ledger. `now` is always passed in. Everything
 * here is a decision this repository has already been bitten by once, written
 * down so the next reviewer can check the decision instead of re-deriving it.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE ENGINE MAY AND MAY NOT DO (established before writing) ─────────
 *
 * **Crypto does not pull, and that is an owner posture, not an unfinished half.**
 * `services/svc-protocol/src/session/spec.ts` refuses to build any session that
 * can call the ERC-20 `approve` selector — its own words: *"an allowance is a
 * delayed transfer."* A recurring on-chain pull IS an allowance. So the crypto
 * path is invoice-and-watch: the cycle opens an invoice, the customer pays it,
 * and `payment.captured` settles the period. #1367's "(no auto-pull)" is that
 * ruling, not a TODO.
 *
 * **Card does not pull either, because the port cannot.** `rails/rail-adapter.ts`
 * declares a `mandate` capability with `createMandate` / `revokeMandate` and
 * **no charge-against-mandate operation at all**, and no registered adapter
 * declares `mandate`. Wiring card auto-pull is a rail-port widening plus a
 * conformance-kit entry, not a subscription change. It stays refused by name
 * (`pay.mandate_rail_absent`) and this module keeps that refusal a first-class,
 * tested outcome rather than a silent skip.
 *
 * So: this module owns the CYCLE — when a period falls due, whether a late one
 * compresses, what a failure does to the next period, and what the charge is
 * allowed to be. It does not own the pull, because there is no legitimate pull
 * to own.
 *
 * ── THE FOUR RULINGS THIS ENCODES ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **1. Idempotency per business event, never per attempt.** The business event
 * is the PERIOD. `pay.subscription:<subscriptionId>:<occurrence>` — and
 * `occurrence` is an integer derived from the schedule, so the key is
 * byte-identical on the third retry at a different second of a different day.
 * `close:${positionId}` survived here; `close:${id}:${randomUUID()}` drained a
 * pot.
 *
 * **2. The interval is the promise.**
 * `adr/2026-08-08-twap-overdue-slice-disposition.md` (Accepted) rules exactly
 * this shape: overdue units *extend* the schedule, they are neither compressed
 * nor forfeited, and due times are re-derived from the resume instant rather
 * than from creation. A subscription that catches up by charging four months at
 * once is that defect with a bigger blast radius, and it needs no user action —
 * a cron host down for a while is enough. So: **at most one charge per
 * subscription per pass**, and a late period re-anchors the frame.
 *
 * **3. A missed cycle is not a skipped cycle.**
 * `adr/2026-08-05-futures-risk-and-mark-law.md` §Funding: *"A period that cannot
 * be settled blocks the next one rather than being silently skipped, because
 * compounding a gap changes what every subsequent position paid."* Held here:
 * an unsettled period blocks the next one, is retried under the same key up to
 * a bound, and then STALLS the subscription with a named reason. It never rolls
 * forward, and it is never recorded as a zero-amount period — `amount > 0` is a
 * database CHECK, so a zero-amount cycle cannot be written at all.
 *
 * **4. The mandate is the ceiling — in money and in time.** Checked at the
 * moment of the charge, not at the moment of the plan, because a mandate can be
 * cancelled or replaced between a period being claimed and that period being
 * retried.
 *
 * ── WHERE THIS DELIBERATELY DIFFERS FROM THE TWAP RULING ────────────────────
 *
 * The TWAP ADR says overdue units extend the schedule, full stop. A subscription
 * cannot extend past its mandate's `endsAt`, because the window is part of what
 * the customer authorised — charging beyond it is charging without consent, and
 * "the mandate is the ceiling" is the harder rule of the two.
 *
 * Silently dropping the tail is also refused (the ADR rejects "skip" for good
 * reasons that apply here too). So the third option is taken, and it is the one
 * the ADR itself takes for a resume past 2× duration: **refuse, name it, and let
 * the merchant re-consent.** A resume that will not fit inside the mandate
 * window returns `pay.subscription_resume_exceeds_mandate` with the projected
 * end; an outage that will not fit stalls with a reason, because there is no
 * caller to refuse to. Unbounded mandates (`endsAt === null`) re-space freely.
