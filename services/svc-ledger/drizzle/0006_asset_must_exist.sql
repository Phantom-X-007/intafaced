-- svc-ledger · an account may only exist in an asset the ledger knows (§4.2)
-- Reversal: 0006_asset_must_exist.down.sql
--
-- THE DEFECT
--
-- Three separate places in this codebase state that value cannot exist in an
-- unregistered asset:
--
--   0003_commodity_asset_kind.sql — "Every one of them needs a row in
--     `ledger.assets` before a balance in it can exist."
--   0004_multi_asset_seed.sql — "a market whose asset has no row here fails at
--     the first ledger post rather than at listing time."
--   packages/contracts/src/instruments.test.ts — "the app boots with a market
--     whose asset does not exist and the first order fails at the ledger rather
--     than at the listing."
--
-- None of it was true. `accounts.asset_id` and `ledger_entries.asset_id` were
-- bare `text` with no foreign key, no CHECK and no lookup, and no code under
-- `services/svc-ledger/src/` read the `assets` table at all — it was declared
-- in `schema.ts` and consulted by nothing.
--
-- So a one-character typo opened a second, fully conformant book. `USTD` and
-- `USDT` both balance per-asset, both stay non-negative, both hash-chain, and
-- `reconcile()` and `verifyChain()` both return ok. The value is real, and it
-- is unreachable: no rail, no market and no asset-keyed query will ever see it,
-- and nothing in the book tells you it is there.
--
-- This is structurally the same hole 0005 closed on the OWNER axis — an
-- identifier the ledger accepts but cannot resolve — left open on the ASSET
-- axis.
--
-- WHY A FOREIGN KEY AND NOT AN APPLICATION CHECK
--
-- The same argument 0005 and the README make for `owner_id`: "an adapter
-- bridging a Java stack is the least likely caller in the OS to route through a
-- TypeScript library, so application-only enforcement would be bypassable by
-- exactly the thing it exists to stop." A CHECK cannot reference another table,
-- so the foreign key is the only form this invariant can take in the database.
--
-- `ON DELETE RESTRICT` is deliberate: retiring an asset that still holds
-- balances must fail loudly. `active = false` is how an asset is withdrawn from
-- new business, and it is a data change, not a deletion.

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- STEP 1 · REFUSE — anything holding value in an asset we cannot name.
--
-- There is no honest automatic repair. Seeding the missing asset would bless a
-- typo and make the phantom book permanent; deleting the rows would destroy
-- value. Both are decisions for a human with the context, so this fails at
-- migrate time on the populated database where the problem actually is, naming
-- every offending asset — rather than succeeding on an empty one and taking the
-- service down on deploy.
