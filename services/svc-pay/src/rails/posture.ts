/**
 * RAIL POSTURE — is this deployment allowed to move real money through a rail
 * that is not real?
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. svc-pay shipped with `MemoryChain` wired into
 * `index.ts` unconditionally and `card-sandbox` registered beside it. Both
 * declare `payout`. `withdrawal.create` takes `railId` from the caller and
 * resolves it through `rails.require(railId, 'payout')`, so on any deployment —
 * including a production one — a user could withdraw through a rail whose
 * counterparty is a `Map`. The path would have debited their real ledger
 * balance, written a made-up provider reference into `withdrawals.rail_ref`,
 * posted `withdrawSettle`, and answered `status: 'sent'`.
 *
 * THAT IS THE WORST AVAILABLE BUG IN THIS SERVICE, and it is worse than it
 * sounds, because it is invisible from the inside. Every invariant holds: the
 * journal balances, the boundary account carries the obligation, the double
 * entry is perfect. The only thing missing is the money, and the only thing that
 * would ever notice is a reconciliation against real custody — which is a job
 * that runs later, if at all, and by then the user has been told for days that
 * their withdrawal was sent.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS MODELLED ON `assertScreeningConfigured` (packages/config), and
 * on purpose: a property the platform claims is asserted at startup, the process
 * refuses to run rather than quietly mislead users about it, and `dev`/`test`
 * are deliberately frictionless because nobody should need a sponsor bank to run
 * a unit test.
 *
 * TWO GATES, NOT ONE:
 *
 *   1. BOOT (`assertRailPosture`) — an enforced environment with a sandbox rail
 *      registered refuses to start. Loud, early, and impossible to miss.
 *   2. RUNTIME (`assertRailMayMoveValue`) — the payout/refund call sites check
 *      again. Boot configuration drifts, adapters get added by later code, and a
 *      guard that only runs once is a guard that only used to run.

 * costs them a day, which is the whole reason the two are now told apart.

 * rail should not also register the sandbox acquirer by default — that would
 * force the override flag and re-open the fabricated-payout hole on the card
 * path. Dev/test keep the sandbox: it is the fixture.
 *
 * Override with `PAY_REGISTER_CARD_SANDBOX=true|false`.
