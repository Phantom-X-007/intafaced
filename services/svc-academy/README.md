# svc-academy

**Live lobbies with capacity tiers (§8.3, §XIII)** plus the **curriculum library** (list · body · study guide · depth). Rooms gated free / staked / invite, sessions inside them, presence, a serializable 2D scene, and Blueprint-path playbooks, lessons and workbooks.

> §8.3: _"Lobbies: rooms (capacity tiers: free/staked/invite), stage + chat + shared charts via ws-gateway; streaming ingest v1 = LiveKit self-hosted (WebRTC SFU, self-hosted per sovereignty; behind `StreamProvider` interface)."_

**Shipped here.** Lobbies (`academy.lobbies`) and the curriculum READ surface (`curriculum` · `curriculumItem` · `curriculumStudyGuide(s)` · `curriculumDepth` — A-P5-2 and after).

**Deliberately not finished here**, each for a stated reason:

| Absent                                                                        | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The provider is `none` and **refuses** — see below.                                                                                                                      |

## This service is `custodial: false`, and the deployment is part of the proof

There is **no `LEDGER_URL`** in its environment and no ledger client in the process. It holds no credential that could reach anything which moves value — the same argument svc-dex's compose block makes. When ambassador pay lands (§8.3 "per-session IFC pay + sub revenue share (ledger recipes)"), it arrives as recipes in `packages/ledger-client` and a `LEDGER_URL`, as its own reviewable change.

The only `numeric(38,18)` column in the `academy` schema is `rooms.min_stake`, and it is a **threshold, not a balance** — a number this service compares against a stake it reads from svc-token, and never stores. It is `numeric(38,18)` because a threshold compared against a scaled amount must carry the same scale; it is a scaled `bigint` in memory and a decimal string on the wire, like every other amount in the OS.

---

## Who may take a seat

One pure function, `decideSeat()`, is the whole rule — read by the join path, by the "can I join" badge, and by its tests, so they cannot drift apart.

| Room access | Admitted when                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `free`      | there is a seat left                           |
| `staked`    | `stakeOf(caller) >= room.minStake`, and a seat |
| `invite`    | a live invitation, and a seat                  |

Two decisions worth naming:

- **The gate is checked before the seat count.** Telling somebody a room is full when they were never eligible sends them back to wait for a seat they could not use; telling them they need to stake first is something they can act on.
- **The host is admitted unconditionally.** A host who drops and reconnects would otherwise find their own session full — the seat they vacated having been taken while they were away — leaving the room with no stage. It is also why an ambassador running a staked room does not have to stake into it.

The stake gate **fails closed**, but it is only consulted for `staked` rooms (`needsStakeCheck`). That is what keeps an unreachable svc-token from emptying the free and invite-only lobbies too.

The seat itself is claimed under `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the session row, so two people racing for the last seat cannot both get it. The **gate** is evaluated before that lock is taken, deliberately: a stake lookup is a network call, and holding the busiest row in a live lobby across one would serialise every join behind svc-token's latency.

---

## Who may open a room — and why it is not a scope

`academy:write` is issued to every session (`packages/auth/src/scopes.ts`), because taking a seat is a write and a lobby nobody may sit in is not a lobby.

Hosting is a different question, and §4.1 already answered it: `rank_thresholds.perks` is "the machine-readable perk table other services query", and the field it carries for this service is **`lobbyHostRights`** — false at ranks 0–3, true from rank 4 (`services/svc-identity/src/rank/thresholds.ts`). `createRoom` reads it from svc-identity over the internal S2S secret and refuses without it.

Had hosting ridden on the scope, issuing `academy:write` would have handed room creation to every account on the platform in the same commit. §XIII's model is ambassadors and operators running rooms, not anyone with a login.

The perk is checked on `createRoom` **and nowhere else**. `invite`, `scheduleSession`, `startSession`, `endSession` and `updateScene` check `assertHost` against a room the caller already owns. Rank can fall, and a host whose rank slipped mid-residency must still be able to end the session they are running and empty the room — re-checking the perk on `endSession` would strand live attendees in a session nobody is allowed to close.

Like the stake gate, it **fails closed**: an unreadable perk table refuses hosting rather than admitting it, because the alternative is opening room creation to the whole platform for the length of an svc-identity outage.

---

## Streaming is `none`, and says so

`ACADEMY_STREAM_PROVIDER` accepts one value in this build: `none`. §8.3 names LiveKit self-hosted as the v1 ingest; **there is no LiveKit deployment in this environment and no API key for one.**

So `NullStreamProvider` **refuses by name** rather than returning a plausible token. A stub that answered `{ url: 'wss://…', token: 'dev' }` would let a lobby open, let attendees take seats, and fail silently in every browser — which reads to the user as "the platform is broken" and to an operator watching `/health` as nothing at all. `src/stream/provider.test.ts` exists to keep that property when a real provider is added beside this one.

Lobbies still run without it: seats, presence, capacity, invites and the 2D scene canvas need no provider, which is why `join` never calls one.

`/ready` reports `stream.usable: false` rather than 503. A lobby without an SFU is a degraded lobby, not a dead service, and 503 would take the Academy out of the fleet over a feature the rest of it does not need. Tracked as §13 socket `socket.stream-provider`.

## API

tRPC, mounted at `/trpc`, reached through svc-edge at `/api/academy` (port 4016).

| Procedure                     | Scope           | Purpose                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `health`                      | public          | Liveness                                                    |

| `session`                     | `academy:read`  | One session and its live occupancy                          |

| `streamCredential`            | `academy:write` | Join token for the stage — refused while provider is `none` |

| `updateScene`                 | `academy:write` | Write the 2D scene (host only)                              |

### Curriculum

- Paths are exactly Blueprint `curriculumPath`: `foundations` · `markets` · `builder` · `sovereign`.
- Kinds: `playbook` · `workbook` · `lesson`.
- Pure in-process library — no DB table, no progress, no money. **Registry** is
  `src/curriculum/catalog.ts` (slugs, paths, ordering, queries, and no prose at
  all); **content** is `src/curriculum/content.ts` (every body, plus objectives,
  key terms and self-check questions per slug).
- Unknown slug → `academy.curriculum_not_found` (NOT_FOUND).
- A catalog row cannot ship without a body and a scaffold: both lookups throw at
  module load, so an item that teaches nothing fails where a human sees it rather
  than serving an empty screen.
- `estimatedMinutes` is derived from the body at 200 words per minute, never
  hand-typed, so it cannot drift away from what it describes.

#### Depth, and why there is a surface for it

`curriculumInventory` answers _are there 20 playbooks and 3 workbooks_. Counting
is not reading: an older 40-character stub gate once let every spine item pass
while the median body was 258 characters. That gate is gone.

`curriculumDepth` and the import pipeline both use the editorial floor
`CURRICULUM_MIN_BODY_CHARS` (**900** characters). Depth returns `thinSlugs` —
naming what falls short rather than asserting that nothing does. `allDeep` is
true only when the list is empty. Bodies are English (`en`); other locales fall
back and report `fellBack: true` via `curriculumItemLocalized` — a translation
is never invented.

### Certifications → XP (`academy.certs`)

| Procedure                  | Scope           | Purpose                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `certDefinitions`          | `academy:read`  | Code-seeded certs and the curriculum slugs each requires                    |
| `enrollCertPath`           | `academy:write` | Enrol the caller on a path                                                  |
| `markCurriculumComplete`   | `academy:write` | Mark one curriculum item complete (idempotent)                              |
| `grantCert`                | `academy:write` | Grant the caller's cert when complete, **and publish the XP it is worth**   |
| `myCerts` / `certProgress` | `academy:read`  | What the caller has earned, and what is missing                             |
| `certXpPlane`              | `academy:read`  | Is this process publishing awards, under which module/action, at what value |

`grantCert` is safe to call twice. The grant is idempotent on `(user, cert)` and the award carries the same business key, so a repeat is dropped by identity rather than paid twice — that is also how an award missed during a bus outage is recovered. XP amounts are a v0 policy in `src/certs/xp-policy.ts` with a conservative default; product may retune them, and a cert with no policy publishes **nothing** rather than an invented amount.

A seat belongs to `ctx.principal.userId`. **No procedure takes a userId from the input except `invite`**, where naming somebody else _is_ the operation — and that one is host-only, so the caller must already own the room. The scene is written **whole** by the host, not merged per attendee: merging would need a conflict model this does not have, and half a merge is a room that renders differently for different people.

---

## Events

**Publishes:** `intafaced.identity.xp.earned`, on certification grant and nowhere else. **Consumes:** none.

This section used to read "**No NATS connection at all**", and the reason it gave was that the §8.3 event this service would eventually emit is exactly that one — "and certification ships with the curriculum. Connecting to the bus to publish nothing would add a boot dependency that can fail, in exchange for no capability." Certification has now shipped, so the capability is real and the connection buys it.

The boot-dependency objection is answered rather than dropped. The connect is attempted and a failure **degrades**: lobbies, seats, scenes, curriculum and paper drills never needed the bus, so svc-academy stays in the fleet and says what it lost — `/ready` reports `xp.usable: false` and `grantCert` returns `xp: { emitted: false, reason: 'publisher_unavailable' }`. Nothing is silently dropped, because the award is keyed on the grant (`academy.cert:cert:<userId>:<certId>`): granting again re-publishes it, and identity's `xp_events ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) DO NOTHING` makes the repeat a no-op. That is the whole recovery story — no outbox, no sweep.

svc-identity remains the only writer to `rank_state` and the only place a perk is decided (§4.1). Academy awards XP; it does not rank anybody.

**Reads over HTTP** (both authenticated with the shared internal service secret):

- svc-token `/internal/stake/:userId` — staked lobbies only
- svc-identity `/internal/rank/:userId/perks` — `createRoom` only

---

## Ledger

**None.** This service uses no ledger recipes and moves no value — see the custodial note at the top. There is no paid entry path in this PR: the `staked` tier is a **threshold test against a stake svc-token already holds**, not a payment, so nothing is ever debited, held or escrowed here, and there is no in-flight state a crash could strand.

That is the answer to the question this codebase asks everywhere — _if the process dies exactly here, whose money is stranded and how does it come back?_ — and the answer is nobody's, because no money entered. If entry ever becomes **paid** rather than stake-gated, that answer changes, and it arrives as ledger recipes plus a `LEDGER_URL` in its own reviewable change.

| `src/host-rights.test.ts`        | The §4.1 hosting perk, and that every unreadable answer refuses                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `src/stream/provider.test.ts`    | That no fabricated join credential can leave the module                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `src/curriculum/catalog.test.ts` | Spine non-empty, path/kind filters, unknown slug null — **plus** library integrity: unique slugs, unique order per path, every body over the depth floor, scaffolding on every item, no orphan content, every item passing the import validator |

All five are pure and need **no database** — none opens a connection, and none points at the shared `intafaced` instance.

The service's SQL paths are exercised through the fleet's e2e suite rather than a per-service Postgres harness: this service holds no value, and its failure mode is an empty room rather than a lost balance, so the harness cost is better spent on services that move money. The one SQL path that would repay a harness is the capacity race under `FOR UPDATE`, and that is the honest gap in this suite.

## Ambassador programme (Stage-1 — status only)

Appoint / freeze / public badge. **No pay.** Hosting still uses §4.1 `lobbyHostRights` only.

| Capability                        | Gate                             |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Open lobby / invite / run session | `lobbyHostRights` (svc-identity) |
| Programme badge active            | `ambassadors.status = active`    |
| Appoint / freeze                  | operator `admin:write`           |
| IFC pay / revenue share           | **Not built** (Class M Stage-2)  |

Migration: `drizzle/0001_ambassadors.sql`.

## Tournament ladders (Stage-1 — no prize money)

Seasons + ranked standings. **No prize pools.** Kill-switch: `ACADEMY_TOURNAMENT_ENABLED` (flag `academy.tournament`).

| Capability                             | Gate                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| List seasons / standings               | `academy:read` when enabled     |
| Create season / set status / set score | `admin:write`                   |
| Prize fund / payout                    | **Not built** (Class M Stage-2) |

Anti-cheat basics: scores only while season `live`; rank = score DESC, earlier `updated_at` wins ties; frozen/ended refuse score writes.

Migration: `drizzle/0002_tournaments.sql`.

## Paper trading (no live money)

Workbook paper drills consume trade's `paper` market flag. **No prices invented here.** Ops kill-switch: `ACADEMY_PAPER_TRADING_ENABLED` (flag `academy.paper-trading`) — when false, `paperDrill` and `paperDrillResult` refuse `academy.paper_trading_disabled`. Live trade on svc-trade is unaffected.

`paperDrill` answers "may this workbook be drilled on this market". `paperDrillResult` answers "what did it come to" — it replays the caller's completed steps and trade's fills and returns the reading of them. It is **stateless**: academy stores no run and no position, so the caller holds the events and this service holds the rules.

| Capability                            | Gate                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `paperDrill` / `paperOpsStatus`       | `academy:read` when enabled                   |
| `paperDrillResult`                    | `academy:read` when enabled                   |
| Kill paper without killing live       | `ACADEMY_PAPER_TRADING_ENABLED=false`         |
| Real ledger holds / live `placeOrder` | **Never** — trade Stage-1 isolation           |
| A result that is not labelled         | **Never** — `academy.paper_result_unlabelled` |

### Two rules that are enforced, not documented

**Everything a drill produces is sealed.** `sealSimulated` is the only constructor for a paper payload, and every wire schema requires the seal as literals — `simulated: true`, `venue: 'paper'`, `realLedger: false`, `withdrawable: false`, plus the disclaimer in full. The run itself carries `simulated: true`, so every projection (board card, both status lines, the CSV export) reads the label from one place rather than remembering to add it. A status line with the label stripped no longer parses; it does not degrade into something readable as live.

**Nothing is priced here.** Prices, sizes and the mark are the ones **trade published**, handed in as decimal strings — a JSON number is a 400, not a coercion. A fill with no published price is `academy.paper_price_unavailable`; an open position with no published mark comes back `unrealisedPnl: null, markUnavailable: true`. Neither is filled in with a plausible number.

`paper/ledger-isolation.test.ts` reads every module under `src/paper/` and fails the build on any import of the ledger's write surface (client, recipes, `orderHold`, `tradeFill`, `.post(`). The decimal **math** from `@intafaced/ledger-client` is allowed and required — a simulated figure uses the one money implementation, or it is a float pretending.

**Known gap — the flag is taken on trust.** `market.paper` arrives in the input. Academy has no way to ask trade whether a market really is paper: no `packages/contracts` surface publishes trade markets. Until one exists, a caller that lies about the flag gets a drill against a market that is not paper — and academy still posts nothing, so the blast radius is a wrong label rather than a wrong ledger entry. Closing it needs a contracts PR first (see `docs/ops/trk/academy.paper-trading.md`).

- `curriculumInventory` reports spine counts vs title 20 playbooks + 3 workbooks. `titlePromiseMet` is **true** on tip — met by platform-native content, **not** by a licensed library dump. Read it with `curriculumDepth`: the counts were met before any of the items were worth reading.
- Import records validated by `validateImportRecord` / brand checklist (no outbound URLs, no empty stubs). The catalog holds itself to that same bar — `catalog.test.ts` runs every spine item through the validator.
- Do **not** invent proprietary library titles as if the import landed.
