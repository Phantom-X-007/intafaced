/**
 * The slot rule, with no database and no svc-token.

 * These run everywhere, including on a machine with no Docker — which is the
 * point of `decideVendorSlot` being pure. The DB-backed oversell proof in
 * `vendor-slots.test.ts` tests that the LOCK holds; this file tests that the
 * DECISION is right, and the two failures are different.
 *
 * No tier number is written down here either. Capacities are passed in as
 * arguments the way svc-token would supply them, so retuning `vendorSlots`
 * cannot make this file wrong (docs/ops/trk/market.vendors.md:156).
