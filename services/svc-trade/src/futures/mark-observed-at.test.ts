/**
 * THE STALENESS GATES, AND WHETHER ANYTHING CAN ACTUALLY REACH THEM.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT WAS WRONG
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `mark-policy.ts` states the rule its own gates depend on: *"`asOf` is when the
 * quote was OBSERVED, not when it was read. A source that stamps read-time
 * defeats every staleness check below."*
 *
 * `markSourceFromBook` stamped `args.at` — the CALLER's clock — on every quote,
 * unless given a `now` override that **neither production caller supplied**.
 * `markSourceFromDepth` omits it and `markSourceFromVenuePublicBook` omitted it.
 * So every mark in production had age exactly zero, and `maxAgeSeconds: 300` and
 * `liquidationMaxAgeSeconds: 60` were unreachable by construction: a book from
 * 1970 read at a caller clock of 2030 cleared a sixty-second gate.
 *
 * `venueBookIsGatedOnItsOwnObservationTime` below is that reproduction, kept and
 * inverted. Before the fix its `asOf` was the caller's `at`; now it is the
 * venue's, and the four-hour-old book is refused.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE TWO HALVES ARE DIFFERENT, AND ONLY ONE WAS A DEFECT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE VENUE HALF WAS UNAMBIGUOUS. `VenueBookSnapshot.observedAt` already exists
 * and is already required by the contract; `markSourceFromVenuePublicBook` read
 * `snap.bids` / `snap.asks` and threw it away. The truthful value was there and
 * was being discarded. Fixed.
 *
 * THE MATCHING-DEPTH HALF IS NOT A DEFECT AND IS DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED — see
 * `readTimeIsTheHonestAnswerForOurOwnBook` at the bottom, which asserts the
 * decision so that reversing it has to be deliberate rather than accidental.
 * `EngineDepth` carries `bids`, `asks` and `sequence` and NO timestamp. There is
 * no observation time to carry, so the only two options were read-time or an
 * invented one — and an invented `observedAt` is strictly worse than an honest
 * read-time one, because it would put a fabricated number in front of a gate
 * whose entire job is to trust that number.
 *
 * The counter-argument is real and is recorded rather than dismissed: a book
 * that has not moved in an hour is not the same thing as a book quoted an hour
 * ago, and `EngineDepth.sequence` is exactly the handle that could tell them
 * apart. But an unchanged sequence means "nobody traded or re-quoted", which is
 * a LIQUIDITY fact, not an age one — and the size floor
 * (`DEFAULT_MIN_BEST_LEVEL_NOTIONAL`) is already the control for "there is not
 * enough resting here to price against". Turning a sequence into a synthetic
 * age would need svc-matching to report when the book last changed, which is a
 * matching-engine change, not a mark change.
