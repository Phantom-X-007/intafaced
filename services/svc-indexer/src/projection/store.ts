/**
 * THE PROJECTION STORE — the read model, and the reorg contract.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS INTERFACE IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── The problem ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Chain data is not final on arrival. A projection that applies a block by
 * overwriting the current value cannot undo it, because the value it replaced
 * is gone. After a reorg it serves a price that was never on the canonical
 * chain, and nothing about it looks broken — no error, no gap, no alert. The
 * user sees a number. That is the failure this interface exists to make
 * impossible.
 *
 * ── The option not taken: confirmation depth alone ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The usual answer is "only project blocks that are N deep". It is not a reorg
 * strategy, it is a probability knob:
 *
 *   · it makes the read model N blocks stale, always, including the 99.9% of
 *     the time when nothing reorgs. For an order book that is the whole product
 *   · any N is still wrong for a reorg of depth N+1, and the failure mode is
 *     unchanged — silently serving a doomed branch
 *   · it does not answer the question. It reduces how often the question is
 *     asked
 *
 * ── The option taken: provenance + unwind ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every projected row records the block that wrote it, and the state tables are
 * VERSIONED BY BLOCK HEIGHT — one row per (key, block) rather than one row per
 * key. "Current" is the newest version.
 *
 * Repairing a reorg is then `unwindTo(forkHeight + 1)`: delete the versions
 * above the fork. The previous version becomes current again by itself. No
 * replay, no compensating writes, no arithmetic that can be off by one — the
 * repair is a DELETE, and a DELETE is hard to get subtly wrong.
 *
 * The projection is therefore correct at every depth, and blocks can be
 * projected the moment they are seen. Confirmation depth survives as what it
 * actually is: the retention threshold for `prune`, i.e. the deepest reorg
 * repairable without a full re-index, plus a confidence number on reads.
 *
 * ── The cost, stated ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Version rows, and a `DISTINCT ON` on every book read instead of a plain
 * scan. `prune` bounds the first; the second is served by an index whose
 * leading columns are exactly the DISTINCT ON key. The trade is deliberate:
 * this is a read model, and a read model that is fast and wrong is worth less
 * than one that is fast enough and right.
 *
 * ── What is NOT solved here ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A reorg deeper than retained history. `findForkPoint` in `indexer.ts` refuses
 * rather than guesses — see the argument there.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * MONEY
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Prices, quantities and sizes are `Amount` (scaled bigint) across this
 * interface, decimal strings on the wire, and `numeric(38,18)` in Postgres.
 * Never `number`: an order book is nothing but sums, and a float sums
 * 0.1 + 0.2 to something that is not 0.3.
