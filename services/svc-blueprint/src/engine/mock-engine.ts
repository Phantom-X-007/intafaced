/**
 * MockNeuralEngine — the deterministic reference implementation.
 *
 * The real engine is an external deployment (§7.1). This mock exists so that
 * everything *downstream* of it — persistence, crew matching, mentor
 * shortlists, export, erasure — is testable without a network, and testable
 * with exact expected values rather than "some profile came back".
 *
 * The contract it upholds, and the only one worth upholding: **the same session
 * input yields the same profile, always.** That is what makes a crew-matching
 * test able to assert a specific placement, and what makes "re-run onboarding
 * and check you land in the same crew" a meaningful assertion rather than a
 * coin flip.
 *
 * `requestId` is deliberately excluded from the derivation. It identifies the
 * *call*, not the person; including it would make every session produce a new
 * profile and quietly destroy the property above.
 *
 * This is not a simulation of the engine's reasoning and does not pretend to
 * be. It is a stable function from session to profile with the right output
 * shape — which is exactly what a test double should be.
