/**
 * LOANS (§8.1) — collateral lock, LTV marking, margin call, liquidation, accrual.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * IF THE PROCESS DIES EXACTLY HERE, WHOSE FUNDS ARE STRANDED?
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The question this codebase asks everywhere, answered for every money path in
 * this file. `loans.test.ts` proves each row rather than trusting it.
 *
 * ── open(): lock, THEN draw ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   after the `loans` row, before the lock post
 *     Nothing has moved. A `pending` loan with no collateral event. Recovered by
 *     `resumePending`, which re-drives it; abandoned, it is a dead row.
 *
 *   after the collateral lock, before the draw
 *     THE INTERESTING ONE. The borrower's collateral is locked and they have no
 *     principal. Nothing is stranded in the platform's hands: the value is in
 *     `user/<id>/<asset>/collateral/loan:<id>` — an account the ledger says is
 *     theirs — and the reserve has not moved. `resumePending` either completes
 *     the draw (idempotent key, so a retry that raced the crash returns the same
 *     transaction) or `abandonPending` releases the collateral. Both paths end
 *     with the borrower whole.
 *
 *     THE REVERSE ORDER IS THE BUG. Draw-then-lock leaves the borrower holding
 *     spendable principal against no collateral, and no retry closes that window
 *     because they can spend inside it. That is why §8.1 names `collateralLock`
 *     first, and why this is two transactions instead of one convenient post.
 *
 *   after the draw, before the status flip to `active`
 *     `drawLedgerTxId` is set inside the same database transaction as the status,
 *     so this window does not exist. If the process dies after the ledger post
 *     but before the commit, the row stays `pending` and `resumePending` re-posts
 *     the SAME idempotency key — svc-ledger returns the original transaction, and
 *     the second attempt records it. The money moves once; the record catches up.
 *
 * ── accrue(): no money moves at all ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   A crash mid-run leaves the days it committed and not the days it did not.
 *   `unique(loan_id, accrual_date)` means a re-run charges each day exactly once,
 *   and the day list is derived from the LAST ACCRUED DAY rather than from a
 *   clock, so catching up three days and re-running are the same operation.
 *
 * ── repay(): claim row before the post ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   Same shape as `transfer_executions`. The `pending` row is inserted, the
 *   ledger post runs, the row is marked `settled` with its tx id. A crash between
 *   leaves a `pending` row whose ledger key is deterministic, so re-driving finds
 *   the original transaction rather than making a second one. Nothing is stranded
 *   — the borrower's payment either happened or did not, and the row says which.
 *
 * ── liquidate(): the seizure and the sale are ONE transaction ───────────────
 *
 *   The three-step version — release collateral, sell it, apply the proceeds —
 *   has a window in which the borrower holds spendable collateral on a defaulting
 *   loan, and a borrower watching a liquidation notices. `loanLiquidate` posts
 *   the collateral leg and the debt leg together, so there is no instant at which
 *   either side holds value they have not paid for. A crash leaves a `pending`
 *   tranche row and a deterministic key; re-driving settles it once.
 *
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * NO BALANCE, AND NO OUTSTANDING COLUMN
 * ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `outstanding()` below is a SQL aggregate over write-once rows, computed in
 * bigint, every time it is asked. It is never stored. The schema comments explain
 * why at length; the short version is that a mutable debt column written nightly
 * by a job is a figure nothing can contradict, and every liquidation decision
 * would be made from it.
