# Instructions for AI agents

INTAFACED monorepo. Build the product and ship it.

Doctrine: [`INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md`](INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md). Protocol: [`tooling/agent-protocol/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`](tooling/agent-protocol/AGENT_PROTOCOL.md).

## Ship (full access)

1. Review, audit, and debug the change. **Merge when done.** Any agent may merge their own pull request.
2. **Do not wait for CI green.** GitHub Actions and `pnpm verify` are informational, never a ship gate.
3. Start without waiting for a person, an audit seal, FREEZE, a tracker claim, LIVE-LANES, or `pnpm ledger`. A blocked money path refuses closed, with an honest empty state. Leave the audit flag alone.
4. Any product path is fair game once its dependencies are met, including money. A blank price, limit, or sanctions list stays blank: refuse that action with a typed error. Do not invent live §8 magnitudes or sanctions list content.

## Money

1. Move value only through `packages/ledger-client`. No module holds its own balance.
2. Never store money in a `number`. Decimal strings on the wire, scaled bigint in memory.
3. Extend the existing shell, ledger, and `svc-*`. A second app or a **second money book** is out. **Internet leverage law:** [`docs/INTERNET-LEVERAGE-LAW.md`](docs/INTERNET-LEVERAGE-LAW.md). Exchange take/keep/never: [`PRO_TRADER_EXCHANGE_DEFINITIVE_SCOPE.md`](PRO_TRADER_EXCHANGE_DEFINITIVE_SCOPE.md) **§0.3**. Leave FIX, SBE, and Greeks as adapters. Leave npm `ccxt` and a second CLOB uninstalled.

## One chain of work

1. Work in a worktree (`pnpm wt <branch>`), never the main checkout. Bare `git worktree add` is the wrong start. Orca `worktree create` is the same thing with a sidebar card.
2. One service per pull request. Never push `main`.
3. If an open pull request already touches that service, or the same files, leave it and take a different part. Several agents may work at once on different parts.
4. When you stop and this folder is not home, remove the worktree from the home checkout with `git worktree remove --force`. `orca worktree rm` deletes the branch. `git branch -D` deletes the branch. Leave home, OS, and PSP in place. `pnpm wt <branch>` restores a folder.

## INTACHAIN

Trading stays on the house book. Base work that already exists continues. INTACHAIN stays parked until Nitro writes GO. Leave `svc-chain` and P1 unstarted. [`docs/adr/2026-09-03-protocol-rails-until-intachain.md`](docs/adr/2026-09-03-protocol-rails-until-intachain.md).

## What you write

Spend the session on the product. `/grill-with-docs` may add one `GLOSSARY.md` entry, or one ADR in the existing dated `docs/adr/` shape, when a word or a hard-to-reverse decision has just settled. Do not start a `0001-` series. Status boards, LIVE-LANES, and tracker recooks stay unwritten.

Coordination map, not a permission system: [`docs/COORDINATION-TRUTH-LAYERS.md`](docs/COORDINATION-TRUTH-LAYERS.md).

Other companies' screens, for looking: [`docs/references/interface-overview.md`](docs/references/interface-overview.md).

## Skills

Use the installed skills. This file wins where a skill says to wait for a person, wait for CI, or use `git worktree add`.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live as GitHub issues on Phantom-X-007/intafaced. Use the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical roles, each label equal to its name: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one root `GLOSSARY.md` and dated ADRs in `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
