 * `svc-ledger` and `svc-matching` are deliberately ABSENT from `/api/*`. They
 * serve service-to-service HTTP authenticated by a shared secret (#50, #55),

 * `/admin/ledger/*` routes in `admin-api.ts`, which forward one named
 * procedure each rather than opening a path to the money plane.

   *
   * An earlier revision derived the module by stripping `/api/` off the prefix.
   * That works for twelve of the thirteen routes and fails silently on the one
   * that matters: `/api/v1` is the public CCXT REST contract, it forwards to
   * `svc-trade`, and `v1` is not a module id. Two bugs came out of that single
   * assumption.
   *
   * The first is loud: building the map threw at import, so `svc-edge` did not
   * boot at all. The second is the dangerous one, and it is what a "fix" that
   * skipped unmappable prefixes would have shipped — `/api/v1` would have had
   * no module, so killing `trade` would have refused `/api/trade/trpc/
   * orders.create` while `POST /api/v1/orders` kept placing orders. An operator
   * would have read "trade: killed" on the console while the exchange took new
   * risk through the front door.
   *
   * Stating the module makes both impossible: the type requires it, and one
   * upstream naming a different module than its prefix suggests is now a
   * deliberate, reviewable line rather than an accident of string handling.

 * ── Why this list has to exist, and why it must stay short ──────────────────
 *
 * "Enforced at the door" is only a real property if the door is the only way in.
 * The kill-switch is an `onRequest` hook on svc-edge, so it can refuse exactly
 * what svc-edge serves. A service the browser reaches on its own published port
 * is not behind the door, and no hook on the edge can stop it.
 *
 * Until this list existed, `admin-api.ts` accepted a kill for EVERY `ModuleId`,
 * including these. An operator could halt `ws`, receive 200, and read
 * `disabledModules: ["ws"]` back from `/admin/status` while svc-ws kept
 * streaming — the exact failure `kill-switch.ts` opens by describing: "the
 * operator believes the market is halted, the console says it is halted, and
 * orders are being accepted."
 *
 * So the control plane now refuses to arm these, with the reason below in the
 * message. A refusal an operator can read beats a halt that never happened.
 *
 * The gate `tooling/ci/killswitch-reachability.mjs` cross-checks this list
 * against `docker-compose.apps.yml`: any `svc-*` container that publishes a host
 * port and has no edge prefix must appear here, so a service added later cannot
 * become silently unkillable — it either goes behind the door or it is recorded
