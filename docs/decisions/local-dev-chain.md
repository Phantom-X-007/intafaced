# A local dev chain is not a chain decision

**Date:** 2026-07-30 · **Stream B (Denon)** · `feat/spine-local-evm`

`protocol.smart-accounts` carried 27 transitive unlocks and was gated on exactly
one thing: **there was no EVM RPC anywhere in this environment.** `svc-indexer`
booted on `NullChainSource`, `PROTOCOL_FACTORY_ADDRESS` and
`PROTOCOL_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS` defaulted to `0x0`, and every chain-dependent
path refused. Correctly — but nothing had ever returned a value.

This change puts a chain in the compose stack so those paths can. It does **not**
choose a chain for the product.

## What was decided

### 1. Anvil, in `docker-compose.yml`, marked `# no-deploy`

Foundry's `anvil`, pinned at `ghcr.io/foundry-rs/foundry:v1.5.1`, on 8545,
labelled `com.intafaced.deploy: never`, with **no volume**.

The missing volume is deliberate. State is ephemeral, so every start is genesis,
so the deployer is at nonce 0, so `chain:deploy` lands the suite at the same two
CREATE addresses every time. That determinism is what lets
`docker-compose.apps.yml` name real addresses as defaults instead of asking each
developer to copy hex out of a terminal. Persisting the chain would trade that
away for nothing anybody asked for.

**Rejected:** a compose `profile`. A flag you can forget is a partial platform
with no error — the same argument `docker-compose.apps.yml` already makes in its
own header about why apps live in a second file rather than behind `--profile`.

### 2. `solc` from npm, not Foundry or Hardhat, as the compiler

`socket.contract-toolchain` said the Solidity had never been executed. It turned
out never to have been **compiled**.

`solc` is the compiler itself, published to npm as the emscripten build the
Solidity team release alongside every native binary. Pinning it as a
devDependency means every machine and every CI runner produce identical
bytecode; `forge build` downloads a solc into a user-level cache at first use,
which is a version nobody reviews. It also needs no Rust toolchain, no
`foundry.toml`, no submodules, and it works on Windows, which is where this repo
is developed.

Anvil is still the chain. Compiling and running are separate jobs on purpose, so
the local chain can be swapped without touching how contracts are built.

Artefacts are **committed** under `services/svc-protocol/contracts/out/` (the
blanket `out/` gitignore rule needed a negation). Committed output is only
trustworthy if it can be checked, so each artefact carries a `sourceHash` over
the compilation input that the test suite re-derives from the `.sol` files on
disk. `evmVersion` is pinned to `paris`: no PUSH0, so this bytecode runs on
chains that have not adopted Shanghai. A dev chain does not get to make that
call for production.

### 3. Configured is not deployed

Naming real addresses in compose created a way for the service to claim
contracts that are not there — precisely the dishonesty the typed refusals
(#193) removed. So `chainStatus` now splits the question:

| field             | means                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `suiteConfigured` | both addresses are non-zero. Config, not evidence.        |
| `suiteDeployed`   | **`eth_getCode` says both hold code.** Read, every probe. |
| `usable`          | `reachable && suiteDeployed`                              |

`suiteDeployed` is `false` whenever the chain could not be reached, because an
unverifiable claim is not a true one.

---

## What this does **not** decide

- **No production chain.** No network chosen, no deployment key, no deployment
  record, no verified sources. That is a key-custody decision a human makes once
  with a key this repository has never held.
- **Nothing is audited.** `socket.contract-audit` is untouched. A local chain
  proves these contracts compile and behave as documented; it says nothing about
  whether they are safe.
- **No EntryPoint and no bundler.** The ERC-4337 v0.7 EntryPoint is a public
  singleton we do not own and it is not in this repository, so
  `relayUserOperation` still refuses locally with `relay.bundler_unavailable`.
  That is the honest state, and it is asserted as a test so nobody discovers it
  by surprise.
- **`socket.evm-rpc` stays open.** `svc-indexer` still boots `NullChainSource`.
  Its socket is blocked on there being a deployed **CLOB** to read, which this
  does not provide.

## What was proven, and what it protects against

**The CREATE2 cross-check.** `accounts/address.ts` derives an account address in
TypeScript; `AccountFactory.getAddress` derives it in hand-written EVM assembly.
Until now the second had never been executed, so nothing had confirmed they
agree. If they disagree, a user is shown an address during onboarding, funds it
before deployment — which is the entire point of §17.4 — and the factory later
deploys their account somewhere else. Nothing is stolen. The money is simply at
an address with no code and no owner, permanently.

They agree, across 25 owner/salt pairs, against the deployed factory. The
account also lands at the predicted address, is owned by the user rather than by
the relayer who paid for it, and its runtime code is byte-identical to the
EIP-1167 proxy the init code hashes.

**The hand-written ABI.** `chain/abi.ts` was written by hand because there was
no compiler. It is now checked against the compiled ABI — inputs, outputs,
`stateMutability`, `indexed` flags. It agreed exactly. Worth keeping as a gate: a
wrong output type there does not throw, it makes viem decode the same bytes into
a different value, and a session's `validUntil` or `spentWei` comes back wrong
with full confidence.

**The refusals still hold.** `chain/refusal-without-chain.test.ts` points the
real `ProtocolChain` at a real closed socket. It runs with no chain, by design —
if the dev node ever became something the service quietly needs, this fails.

---

## Two bugs the chain surfaced

1. **`ConstantProductPool` does not compile, and never has.** `swapExactIn`
   calls `swap` at lines 177 and 179; `swap` is `external`, which Solidity does
   not permit to be called internally. The AMM pool has never produced bytecode
   and is undeployable. **Not fixed here** — it changes a money contract's
   external surface and belongs to `protocol.amm`. It is pinned as a
   known-broken suite in `scripts/contract-sources.mjs`, so the build fails if it
   starts compiling, or fails differently, without somebody deciding.

2. **`relayUserOperation` returned an opaque 500 for a malformed signature
   envelope.** `SignatureEnvelopeError` was unmapped in `toTrpcError`, so a
   caller's own wrong-shaped bytes arrived as
   `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR: 'Protocol request failed'` — a retry invitation for
   an operation that can never be accepted. Now a 400. Only reachable once there
   was a chain to get past the first read.

## CI

The test job starts anvil with `docker run` (GitHub gives service containers no
way to pass a command, and the foundry image's entrypoint needs one) and sets
`REQUIRE_EVM_CHAIN=1`. That mirrors `REQUIRE_POSTGRES`: the suite may skip on a
laptop with no chain, and must never skip on CI. A silent skip is how "we proved
CREATE2 agrees" quietly stops being true.

---

## Addendum, 2026-08-03 — "every start is genesis" is not "every run is genesis"

The section above is true, and was read as saying something it does not. The
`evm` service holds no volume, so every **container start** is genesis. It is
also `restart: unless-stopped`, so on a developer's machine it does not start —
it runs for days. Between the two, the chain a laptop tests against has
thousands of blocks on it and CI's has ten. `pnpm verify` was reliably green on
CI and could not go green locally, and those two facts have one cause.

Three separate failures came out of that gap. They are worth listing because
only one of them is the one everybody looked at.

**1. Two suites on one sender.** Each live-chain suite hand-picked one of
anvil's ten pre-funded accounts and recited the others' indices in its own
header. Maintained by copy-paste across three services, it had drifted into
three collisions. Two suites on one account both read the pending nonce, both
get N, both broadcast, and the loser gets `nonce too low` — a different file
each run, none of them with anything wrong in its own diff. Four agents lost
time to it before anybody compared the indices.

This one is **not** actually about chain age. viem reads the pending nonce from
the node every time, so a high nonce is harmless; the race is between two
senders and would happen on a fresh chain too. Chain age only moved the odds.
Fixed by deriving each sender from the suite's own path — see the banner in
`services/svc-protocol/scripts/dev-chain.ts` and the gate in
`services/svc-protocol/src/chain/dev-chain-isolation.test.ts`.

**2. A rescan whose cost is the chain's entire history.** svc-pay's live rail
suite called `resetScan(0n)`, and `EvmLiveChain.refresh()` walks blocks one
`eth_getBlock` at a time. On CI that is a handful of round trips; against a
container that has been up for days it is thousands, and it eventually blows the
5s test timeout. Nothing in the code changed on the day it started failing — the
container just got older. It now rescans from the block its own deposit landed
in, which reads the same real blocks and drops only the re-reading of history.

**3. Determinism that only holds shortly after a restart.** `chain:deploy` lands
the suite at fixed CREATE addresses because the deployer is at nonce 0 — true at
genesis, not true on day three. That is why anvil's ten pre-funded accounts are
now reserved: derived suite senders live on the `m/44'/60'/1'` branch and cannot
move account 0's nonce. Re-running `chain:deploy` against an aged chain still
lands somewhere other than the addresses compose names; the honest fix is
`docker compose restart evm` first, and `deploy-dev.ts` already refuses rather
than letting a wrong address be wired into anything.

**What was rejected.** Making the dev chain ephemeral for test runs: it does not
fix (1) at all — two suites on one account collide on a fresh chain too — it
serialises `pnpm verify` on docker, and it throws away the long-lived chain a
developer's running platform is pointed at. `evm_snapshot`/`evm_revert` per
suite: it rewinds the whole node, which is the entire reason `evm-reorg` exists
on 8546; see that service's comment in `docker-compose.yml`.
