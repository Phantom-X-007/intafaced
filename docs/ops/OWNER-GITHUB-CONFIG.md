# Owner GitHub config — the five settings only an admin can change

**Home for these findings.** They were queued 2026-08-04 inside `docs/BOARD-CLEAR-HUMAN-BLOCKERS.md`, a campaign file that is otherwise dead. They are not campaign artifacts — they are standing repo-security facts, and they outlived the campaign. Moved here 2026-08-07.

**Who can act:** `Phantom-X-007` is the only `admin`. `ZenYoda3` and `shehzad002` have `write`. No agent can change any of this. **Do not** `PUT` protection, `PATCH` the repo, or run `tooling/scripts/setup-github.mjs` from an agent session.

**What changed since these were filed:** the repo went **public**. Every "needs GitHub Pro" blocker below was priced for a private repo and is now **free**. G1–G3 are still three admin clicks (G1 is no longer a 404 — the remaining clicks **strengthen** the thin rule).

## Three clicks for `Phantom-X-007` (G1 / G3 — G2 stays off)

Agents cannot click these. Do not run `setup-github.mjs` unless you intend to write admin settings yourself. Re-derive live settings first (commands at the top).

1. **G1 — Settings → Branches → `main` rule.** Require status checks: **Doctrine gates**, **Typecheck & build**, **Tests** (swap to **CI merge seal** after named shards land), **Gitleaks**, **Dependency audit**. Set **required approving reviews = 0**. Do **not** require code owners. Do **not** require “up to date before merging” (rebase-wait is the old slowdown; `push:main` is the trunk seal). Force-push off. Optionally: do not allow bypassing (include administrators) so red cannot be admin-merged.
2. **G2 — leave CODEOWNERS advisory.** A required owner review waits on Nitro or Denon. The file already pings; that is enough.
3. **G3 — Settings → General → Pull Requests.** Enable **Allow auto-merge**. Squash-only and auto-delete are already on.

## Why G5 is the one worth thinking about

G1–G4 are settings. G5 is not.

Every ownership rule in this repo — the class matrix, the lane split, the human locks — assumes you can tell who did something. On the git record you cannot: 692 of the last 877 commits are authored `Nitro`, and Nitro does not type git commands. That means the entire coordination layer is enforcing a distinction the machine cannot see.

This does not need fixing today, and a machine account has its own costs. But it should be a decision rather than an accident, because it silently sets the ceiling on how much any ownership rule can ever be worth.

## G5 decision frame (2026-08-15)

**Tracker:** `GH-G5`. **Not an agent fix.** Agents do **not** create GitHub users, do **not** mint a second `write` collaborator, and do **not** seal this row by shipping prose. Denon already labelled G5 **structural** (table Action). This section prices the two options so the ceiling is chosen, not inherited.

**What the git record actually is.** `ZenYoda3` is one GitHub user with `write`. Nitro-the-operator and the Nitro agent swarm both push as that user. Commit author `Nitro` is therefore **not** evidence that a person typed the command. LIVE-LANES, the class matrix, and human locks still bind as **process** law. They are not mechanically recoverable from `git log` / GitHub blame.

**What a machine account would actually buy.** A second identity on the collaborators list, used only by swarm tokens, so later commits split “this PAT” vs “that PAT”. It does **not** prove a human sat at the keyboard: whoever holds either token can still push. Person-attribution stays a social fact. The machine only sees two logins.

### Option A — swarm machine account

A separate GitHub user (human-created, admin-invited) holds the swarm `GH_TOKEN`. `ZenYoda3` stays Nitro-the-operator.

| Cost             | Why it bites                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin act        | Someone must create the user, invite `write`, rotate tokens, and keep the split. Agents are forbidden to do that.                                                   |
| Secret sprawl    | Two PATs, two agent-auth files, two failure modes. A leaked swarm token is still `write` on a public money repo.                                                    |
| False confidence | CODEOWNERS / required reviewers still cannot tell “Nitro typed this” vs “Nitro’s laptop ran the agent”. Authorship becomes _token_ evidence, not _person_ evidence. |
| Process rewrite  | Every Nitro agent prompt, `gh` helper, and merge path must refuse `ZenYoda3`. One missed export and the split is theatre.                                           |
| Blame noise      | History before the cut stays mixed. Reviews that treat author as owner will still misread the old majority of commits.                                              |

Pick A only if Denon wants GitHub rails (after G1) to _treat swarm pushes as a distinct login_ — for example required-reviewer rules that exclude the swarm identity. That is an admin follow-on, not this docs PR.

### Option B — accept the authorship ceiling

Keep `ZenYoda3` as the shared Nitro write identity. Treat `git` author / GitHub user as **not evidence** of a person. Enforce who-coded-what in LIVE-LANES + tracker owner + PR body, the same way the repo already does.

| Cost                  | Why it bites                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mechanical ceiling    | No ownership rule that needs “this commit was a human” can ever be proven from git. That is the ceiling, stated.             |
| Audit stories         | External readers will keep counting “Nitro authored N commits” and be wrong. Correct them in prose; do not invent a git fix. |
| G1 still matters more | Branch protection and required checks constrain _what_ can land, not _which person_ landed it. G5 does not unblock G1.       |

This matches the table’s existing Action: structural; do not “fix” in agents.

### Recommendation (not a seal)

**Accept Option B** as the working default.

Denon already called G5 structural. Sealing Option A without an admin-created account would be a silent pick plus an incomplete act. Option A’s extra login does not restore person-attribution; it adds token hygiene and a second `write` seat for a distinction the coordination layer already stores off-git.

`GH-G5` stays **open** in `docs/ops/owner-ruling-packet.json` until Denon seals B (or explicitly orders A and a human creates the account). Agents continue: no GitHub user create; no G1–G4 live-column refresh here (P4-03 sibling).
