/**
 * THE SEQUENCED BOOK TRACKER — §27's "WS-first, sequenced books, gap-detected".
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE FAILURE THIS FILE EXISTS TO MAKE IMPOSSIBLE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A websocket depth stream that silently drops one update leaves a book that
 * answers every question instantly, renders perfectly, and is WRONG. There is
 * no symptom: no exception, no latency spike, no gap in a log. Just a price that
 * was never on the venue, handed to a router that has no way to doubt it. The
 * first anyone knows is a fill at a level nobody was offering.
 *
 * So this tracker has one non-negotiable property, and everything else in the
 * file is in service of it:
 *
 *   **`book()` returns `null` unless every update since the snapshot has been
 *   proven contiguous.** A gap does not degrade the book, it withholds it.
 *
 * Serving a desynced book "because it is probably still close" is the same bug
 * as not checking at all, only deliberate.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE JOIN — the window a gap detector cannot see
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The subtle failure is not the gap mid-stream. It is the join: you fetch a
 * snapshot over REST and you subscribe over WS, and updates that land between
 * the two are lost with NO sequence discontinuity to prove it — because the
 * snapshot's sequence is already past them.
 *
 * The only correct order is: **subscribe first, buffer deltas, then snapshot.**
 * Then the join is arithmetic rather than luck: the first buffered delta not
 * already contained in the snapshot must satisfy
 *
 *     firstSequence <= snapshot.sequence + 1 <= lastSequence
 *
 * If it starts later than that, updates were lost and the SNAPSHOT IS TOO OLD —
 * fetch a newer one. This tracker refuses to go live until that holds, which is
 * why `onSnapshot` can answer `snapshot-stale` and why a caller must loop.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY SEQUENCES ARE RANGES
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Venues coalesce several updates into one frame under load, and publish the
 * range they cover. A tracker that assumed one update per message would call
 * every batched frame a gap and resnapshot forever — turning a busy market into
 * a self-inflicted outage. Hence `firstSequence`/`lastSequence`, and hence the
 * `<=` on the left of the join condition: an OVERLAPPING batch is fine, because
 * levels are absolute totals and re-applying one is idempotent. Only a batch
 * that starts strictly beyond `sequence + 1` is a gap.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT IS DELEGATED
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The mutation itself is `@intafaced/market-data`'s `applyDelta` — this repo's
 * prior art, already property-tested against `diffDepth` over generated books.
 * A second implementation of the same walk is a second thing to be wrong, and
 * the server that produces our own deltas uses that one.
 *
 * Its sequence check then runs a second time, on data this file has already
 * validated. That redundancy is intentional: it is an assertion that the
 * translation from venue ranges to `market-data`'s single-step model is right,
 * and it fires in tests rather than in production.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * MONEY
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Every wire level is read through `readDecimal` before it reaches the book, so
 * a venue that starts emitting JSON numbers is refused at the boundary rather
 * than silently rounded into the depth. Prices are canonicalised through
 * `formatAmount` so `"30000"` and `"30000.0"` cannot become two levels at one
 * price — a duplicate level is phantom liquidity, and the router would size
 * against it.
