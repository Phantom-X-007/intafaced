/**
 * THE CLOCK.
 *
 * Everything with a timer in it lives here, so `DepthHub` has none and every
 * one of its behaviours is reachable from a test in a single tick.
 *
 * ── Why this polls ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §5.1 gives the engine no outbound depth feed, and the events it does publish
 * cannot rebuild a book: `intafaced.matching.order.accepted` carries
 * `{orderId, marketId, sequence}` — no side, no price, no quantity
 * (packages/events/src/catalog.ts). Deriving depth from the bus would need a
 * wider payload, which is a `packages/events` PR that must land on its own
 * first (§15.2). Until it does, the only complete and correctly-sequenced
 * source of L2 depth in the platform is `GET /markets/:id/depth`. Native L3
 * is a separate `GET /markets/:id/depth/l3` — never synthesized from L2.
 *
 * So: poll it, diff it, and let the sequence do the rest. The cost is bounded
 * and legible — one GET per SUBSCRIBED market per tick. A market nobody is
 * watching is not polled, which is what keeps this from becoming a recorder.
 *
 * ── Why a tick with no change still calls `ingest` ──────────────────────────
 *
 * The hub's lag repair rides on the tick, not on the delta. A client that
 * dropped a frame and then watched the market go quiet must still be repaired,
 * and it can only be repaired on a tick that happens.
