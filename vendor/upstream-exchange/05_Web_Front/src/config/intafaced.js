/**
 * INTAFACED — the sovereign platform client.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Everything our own services expose reaches the browser through ONE door:
 * svc-edge. Nothing here names a service port, and nothing here talks to a
 * service directly — the dev-server proxy maps `/api/*` onto the edge (see
 * ../../config/index.js), and the edge owns the route table. An unlisted
 * prefix 404s there rather than falling through to the internal network.
 *
 * The services speak tRPC over HTTP. The wire shape is fixed and small:
 *
 *   query     GET  /api/<module>/trpc/<procedure>?input=<url-encoded JSON>
 *   mutation  POST /api/<module>/trpc/<procedure>   body: <JSON input>
 *   success   { "result": { "data": ... } }
 *   failure   { "error": { "message", "data": { "code", "httpStatus", ... } } }
 *
 * ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS A CONTRACT NOT A SHORTCUT. svc-trade also publishes
 * a CCXT-shaped REST surface under `/api/v1/*` (svc-edge routes that prefix to
 * the same service with `preservePath: true`). It is not tRPC: the body IS the
 * answer, and a failure is `{ code: <CcxtErrorCode>, message, intafacedCode }`
 * at the top level. `rest()` below speaks it, and `classify` reads both shapes,
 * so the screens keep exactly one client and exactly one failure taxonomy.
 *
 * WHY `fetch` AND NOT `this.$http`. main.js sets `Vue.http.options.emulateJSON`
 * globally, which form-encodes every POST body. tRPC needs a JSON body, and
 * main.js is owned elsewhere, so these calls use the platform's own transport
 * rather than quietly breaking the vendor's.
 *
 * Money never becomes a `number` on this path. Decimal strings arrive as
 * strings and are rendered as strings.
 *
 * WHAT A 200 IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. Until `ix-wire.js` existed, this file
 * treated `res.ok && body.result` as proof that the payload was the thing the
 * screen expected, and handed `body.result.data` over unread. A 200 is evidence
 * that a service answered; it is not evidence about what it said. Every call
 * here now takes an OPTIONAL `schema` — a validator from `../assets/js/ix-wire.js`
 * — and a payload that fails it comes back as `INVALID_RESPONSE` naming the
 * field and the rule, rather than as a float in an order form. Opt-in per call
 * site on purpose: a call that has not adopted a schema is exactly as safe as
 * it was before, and visibly not yet better.
