/**
 * SANCTIONS / REGION SCREENING LIST — §24 Lane A, as configuration.
 *
 *   "Sanctions-screening on the hosted front-end per applicable law; the
 *    contracts themselves are permissionless infrastructure."
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 *
 * `checkAccess` has always been able to refuse a region. Nothing has ever told
 * it which regions to refuse, so it refused none — and a decision that screened
 * nothing was byte-for-byte identical to a decision that screened a real list
 * and cleared you. Every call site, every test and every log line saw the same
 * `allowed`. The mechanism was green because it was empty.
 *
 * This file makes the states different things:
 *
 *   `unset`          → NO list was consulted. Not "clean", *unknown*.
 *   `listed`         → a list exists, and this region is not on it.
 *   `reviewed-empty` → somebody with standing reviewed it and recorded that no
 *                      region is screened out. A decision, not a default.
 *
 * and `assertScreeningConfigured` (jurisdiction.ts) refuses to let a
 * production-like process boot in the first state.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS FILE IS ONE AUTHORITY. THE JURISDICTION MATRIX IS A DIFFERENT ONE.
 *
 * A `ScreeningList` is COUNSEL-SUPPLIED CONTENT: who may not be served, for
 * legal reasons, under a named governance record.
 *
 * A `JURISDICTION_MATRIX` entry is BUSINESS CONFIGURATION: which markets we have
 * decided to open, at what tier, with what limits — edited by ordinary
 * contributors in ordinary PRs, for licensing, commercial or product reasons.
 *
 * They used to share this type. `JURISDICTION_MATRIX` blocks were folded into a
 * `ScreeningList` and merged with the env list, so ONE commercially-blocked
 * region flipped the production boot guard from "refuse to start" to
 * "satisfied" while the sanctions list was still empty and nobody in counsel had
 * supplied anything. That is exactly what the pay spec forbids — "nobody can
 * loosen a sanctions check while tuning something else" — arriving through the
 * jurisdiction matrix instead of through fraud.
 *
 * So: nothing in this file may be constructed from the matrix. A matrix block is
 * a `BusinessBlock` (jurisdiction.ts), it still refuses the region, and it
 * cannot satisfy this authority's guard. Where the two cannot be told apart —
 * a `blocked: true` entry whose reason nobody wrote down — the ambiguous case
 * REFUSES in both directions: the region stays blocked, and the boot guard stays
 * unsatisfied.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CONTAIN
 *
 * A sanctions list. It ships empty and it stays empty until counsel supplies
 * one. Naming jurisdictions here would be an engineer drafting a legal control:
 * too few is a sanctions breach, too many is unlawful discrimination, and the
 * repo has no standing to be wrong in either direction. The MECHANISM is
 * engineering; the CONTENTS are a compliance decision with a named owner.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE CONFIGURED SHAPE — one variable, three answers
 *
 *   INTAFACED_SANCTIONS_REGIONS
 *     Unset or blank      → `unset`. Nobody has done this. Boot guard refuses.
 *     `none`              → `reviewed-empty`. See below; requires attribution.
 *     A list of codes     → `listed`.
 *
 *     A list is comma-separated. Each item is an ISO-3166 alpha-2 code,
 *     optionally followed by `:` and the reason an operator (or a refused user)
 *     should see. Whitespace around items is ignored; codes are case-insensitive.
 *
 *       INTAFACED_SANCTIONS_REGIONS="AA:UNSC resolution ref,BB:programme ref"
 *
 *     A reason is not required, but supply one. It is what the refusal says,
 *     what the audit log carries, and what tells the next operator whether an
 *     entry is still current or a leftover from a lifted programme.
 *
 *     ONE VARIABLE, NOT TWO, on purpose: "reviewed and deliberately empty" is an
 *     answer to the same question a list answers, so it lives in the same place.
 *     A second variable would create a state where both are set and contradict
 *     each other, and there is no honest way to resolve that.
 *
 *   INTAFACED_SANCTIONS_LIST_SOURCE
 *     Free-text provenance for the answer above — the governance record, ticket,
 *     or published list revision it came from. Recorded on every screening
 *     decision so "who decided this, and when" is answerable from a log line
 *     rather than from someone's memory.
 *
 *       INTAFACED_SANCTIONS_LIST_SOURCE="counsel-memo-2026-08-01"
 *
 *     OPTIONAL for a list, MANDATORY for `none`. Not an inconsistency: a
 *     populated list is self-evidencing — someone typed region codes and reasons,
 *     and the content itself is the act. `none` has no content. Attribution is
 *     then the ONLY evidence that a review happened rather than somebody
 *     silencing a boot failure, so without it there is nothing to distinguish
 *     the two and the parser refuses.
