/**
 * REACHABILITY GATE - a module nothing can reach is not shipped work.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Between #905 and #946 the L3 slice factory produced 151 modules that
 * re-declared a constant already defined elsewhere and asserted the copy
 * against a hardcoded literal. Every one passed doctrine gates, format,
 * typecheck, tests and CI. The stamp-mill gate led with `docsOnly`, so it never
 * looked at them (#884). 22k lines, zero reachable behaviour - and each copy
 * was a silent drift trap: change the real list and the copy disagrees while CI
 * stays green.
 *
 * THE RULE
 * --------
 * A non-test source module fails when BOTH are true:
 *   1. it imports nothing from this repo, and
 *   2. nothing outside its own test file imports it.
 *
 * Both halves matter. A real drift guard imports the live source it guards, so
 * it passes on (1) - that is exactly what separates the nine kept
 * `*-honesty.ts` files from the 151 deleted ones. A feature that is built but
 * not yet wired imports real code too, so it passes as well: this gate catches
 * MANUFACTURED code, not unfinished code. Law: docs/NITRO-L3-SLICE-FACTORY-LAW.md.
 *
 * ponytail: importer detection is a basename match over import specifiers, not
 * a module resolver. It errs toward finding an importer, so the failure mode is
 * a miss, never a false accusation. Swap in a real resolver if a miss costs us.

/**
 * PARKED - built, specced, not yet wired. Each entry is a real Stage-1/Stage-2
 * module with a TRK spec and no caller yet. Parking them here is the point:
 * unwired work stays VISIBLE and owned instead of quietly collecting dust.
 *
 * This list may only SHRINK. When a parked module gains a caller the scan says
 * so and the row must be deleted - that is the whole mechanism. Adding a row is
 * a decision to owe the wiring, not a way to pass the gate.

/**
 * POSIX-shaped paths, on every platform.
 *
 * This was `new URL('../..', import.meta.url).pathname`, which on Windows is
 * `/C:/Users/…` — a leading slash the filesystem does not use — while `walk()`
 * returns `C:\Users\…` from `join`. Three things then broke at once, and every
 * one of them SILENTLY:
 *
 *   · `f.includes('/src/')` matched nothing, so `sources` was EMPTY and the
 *     scan inspected zero modules.
 *   · `relative(ROOT, f)` produced `..\..\..\Users\…`, which matches no
 *     PARKED key.
 *   · so every PARKED row looked "freed", and the gate instructed the operator
 *     to delete six rows for modules that are still imported by nothing but
 *     their own test.
 *
 * Following that instruction would have DISARMED the gate for those six
 * modules — the exact outcome it exists to prevent. Linux CI was unaffected
 * (no drive letter, `/` separators), so this was green there and wrong on every
 * Windows checkout, which is the worst place for a gate to disagree with itself.
 *
 * Normalising here and at the walk keeps both platforms on one shape.
