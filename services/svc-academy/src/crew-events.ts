/**
 * crewMemberCreated → academy lobby route. NOT WIRED. NOT A CLASS B CLOSE.
 *
 * This header used to say "(ADR D-S-13 Class B close)" and it was false. Nothing
 * imports this file except its own unit test: `index.ts` has never referenced it,
 * and — read that file's header — svc-academy holds NO BUS CONNECTION AT ALL, so
 * `subscribeCrewMemberCreated` could not attach even if something did import it.
 * `MemoryCrewLobbyRouter` below is a process-local `Map`; no lobby is routed
 * anywhere by this code.
 *
 * It was nevertheless enough to make `event-wiring` report the event as wired —
 * that gate matched the TEXT of `bus.subscribe(…)` — and on that basis the honest
 * `crewMemberCreated` socket entry was deleted from the catalog. The gate now
 * decides wiring by reachability from the service entrypoint, so this file counts
 * for nothing until it is mounted, and the socket entry is back.
 *
 * KEPT, not deleted: the shape is right, and it is roughly what the real consumer
 * will look like. What it is not is a consumer. Mounting it means giving
 * svc-academy a bus first — a real decision about this service's boot
 * dependencies, and exactly the "scope question" ADR D-S-13 reserves for the
 * owner. See `CLASS_B_AWAITING_A_DECISION` in tooling/ci/event-wiring.mjs.
