# svc-blueprint

**The Identity Blueprint (§7.1).** Phase 4.

Onboarding runs a guided session, the **Neural Engine** derives a profile from it, and this service persists that profile, places the user in a crew on complementary-profile heuristics, and shortlists mentors. It also owns the two promises §7.2 makes to the user: **export** and **hard delete**.

**What this service is not:** it does not hold balances, it does not render the share card, and it does not contain the engine. The engine is an external deployment reached over an HTTP contract at `BLUEPRINT_ENGINE_URL`; what lives here is the `NeuralEngineClient` interface in front of it.

## Branding — Doctrine §0.7

> User-facing copy references only: **Identity Blueprint**, **Sovereign Intelligence**, **Neural Engine**.

In this package the rule is stricter than "user-facing". No third-party system name appears anywhere — not in a comment, not in a variable, not in a test fixture, not in a migration. This is the one service where someone would naturally type a vendor's name while explaining what the engine does, so the rule is absolute here rather than contextual.

Two things enforce it:

- `pnpm scan:brand` — repo-wide, in CI (`tooling/ci/brand-scan.mjs`).
- `src/brand.test.ts` — the same rule, run against this package as part of its own suite (§7.2's copy-scan, asserted from the inside). It reads its vocabulary out of the scanner rather than duplicating it, so this package contains no forbidden name even in the test that hunts for them. It is deliberately stricter than the repo scan: it also covers `.sql`, which `brand-scan.mjs` skips.

---

## API

tRPC (`src/router.ts`). Every procedure operates on `ctx.principal.userId` and never on an id from the input — there is no "export that account" path, by design.

| Procedure | Scope             | Purpose                                                        |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `health`  | public            | Liveness                                                       |
| `onboard` | `blueprint:write` | Session → engine → profile → crew placement → mentor shortlist |
| `me`      | `blueprint:read`  | The caller's own Blueprint                                     |
| `mentors` | `blueprint:read`  | The caller's mentor shortlist                                  |
| `export`  | `blueprint:read`  | **§7.2 portable** — everything this service holds, as JSON     |
| `erase`   | `blueprint:write` | **§7.2 deletable** — hard delete that cascades                 |

HTTP: `GET /health`, `GET /ready`. Readiness reports the engine, because a Blueprint cannot be produced without it and reporting ready while it is down routes onboarding at a service that can only fail it.

`blueprint` is non-custodial and `minTier: 'none'` in `JURISDICTION_MATRIX`, so the guard checks scope and region, not verification tier.

## Events

**Publishes**

| Subject                                   | When                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `intafaced.blueprint.blueprint.created`   | A Blueprint exists — svc-identity sets `profiles.blueprint_id` |
| `intafaced.blueprint.crew_member.created` | Crew placement — svc-academy routes the lobby                  |
| `intafaced.blueprint.blueprint.deleted`   | Hard delete — every consumer drops cached profile data         |

**Consumes** — nothing yet.

**No payload on this bus carries profile content.** Not an axis, not a guardrail, not a curriculum path. Consumers that need the profile read it back through `packages/contracts` under the user's own authority. `crew_member.created` carries `role` because that is the crew's shape and svc-academy needs it to route a lobby.

### The identity reference is set and cleared by event, not by SQL

`profiles.blueprint_id` lives in svc-identity's schema. §2 forbids this service writing it. So:

- on create, `blueprintCreated` carries the id svc-identity stores;
- on erase, `blueprintDeleted` tells it to clear the field.

`blueprintDeleted` is keyed on the **user**, not the blueprint, so a redelivery clears the field once rather than clobbering a field the user has since legitimately repopulated by onboarding again.

---

## Ledger

**This service holds no balances and posts no ledger transactions.**

There is no `@intafaced/ledger-client` import in this package and there should never be one. `crews.xp` is a count of shared achievement — it is deliberately a `bigint` and not `numeric(38,18)` so it can never be mistaken for a balance, and a test asserts that no `numeric` column exists anywhere in the schema. Doctrine §0.6 is satisfied here by there being no value to hold.

Crew treasuries are a real future feature (§33 Crew Vaults, Phase 5P) — and when they land, the money lives in the ledger and in `svc-protocol`, not here.

---

## The engine interface

`NeuralEngineClient` (`src/engine/neural-engine.ts`) is the whole surface of the dependency:

```ts
interface NeuralEngineClient {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly capabilities: readonly EngineCapability[];
  health(): EngineHealth;
  profile(request: BlueprintRequest): Promise<EngineProfileResult>;
}
```

Shape mirrors `LiquiditySource` in `packages/venue-adapter` (§5.2) on purpose — id, capabilities, synchronous `health()` for routing decisions, async work. An engineer who has read one adapter has read both.

Two implementations:

- **`HttpNeuralEngineClient`** — the real one. One POST, one schema check, one error taxonomy. It does not log the request body, does not retry on its own, and does not fall back to a default profile. A fabricated profile is indistinguishable downstream from a real one and would place a real person in a crew on the strength of a timeout.
- **`MockNeuralEngine`** — deterministic. The same session yields the same profile, always, which is what lets the tests assert a _specific_ placement rather than merely that one happened. `requestId` is excluded from the derivation: it identifies the call, not the person.

`BLUEPRINT_ENGINE_MODE` selects between them **explicitly**. There is no fallback to the mock when the real engine is unreachable — that would hand stub profiles to real people and look healthy doing it.

---

## Determinism

> A user who re-runs matching must land in the same crew.

Held up by four things:

1. **The scorer is pure.** `matching/crew-matching.ts` has no clock, no randomness and no I/O. Tested without a database.
2. **Ties break on crew id.** Equal scores are common. Postgres does not promise row order, so an unbroken tie would make placement depend on the order rows came back — a function of the candidate _set_ is the requirement, not of the sequence it arrived in.
3. **New crew ids are derived, not generated.** `newCrewId(season, founder)` is a hash. A retried placement forms the same crew instead of stranding an empty one; `gen_random_uuid()` would leave litter behind every network blip.
4. **Placement short-circuits on existing membership.** Re-running onboarding does not move anyone. The crew name is derived from the crew id too, so it survives a restore that a counter would not.

`Math.random()` and `Date.now()` appear nowhere on these paths. Timestamps are written (`match_runs.ts`); none is read back by anything that decides where a person goes.

### Complementary, not similar

The score rewards **difference**: a candidate scores highest against the crew that shares least with them. A crew of four people who all decide analytically has one perspective and four voices.

`crewRole` carries the most weight — four builders and no anchor is a crew that ships nothing and notices nobody. Rhythm and learning mode carry the least: a crew that disagrees about when to wake up has a scheduling problem, not a blind spot.

`EMPTY_CREW_SCORE` (6000 bps) is the one genuinely arbitrary number, and it does real work: **"best available" is not "good enough"**. A crew scoring below it loses to forming a new one, which is what keeps someone out of a crew of their own clones. Set it higher and the population shatters into crews of one; set it to zero and the echo chamber wins.

**The mentor heuristic is deliberately different.** A mentor should _differ_ in judgement (that difference is the lesson) and _match_ in learning mode (that sameness is the channel). Reusing the crew scorer here would shortlist mentors who cannot teach the student they were matched with — there is a test that fails if someone "simplifies" it that way.

---

## PII — §10

The profile is PII-adjacent. What the user actually said is PII outright.

- **Raw session input and birth data are never persisted.** They cross the wire to the engine and are dropped. There is no column for them, and that absence is the control — a column that does not exist cannot leak, cannot be logged, and cannot be recovered from a backup.
- A CHECK constraint (`blueprints_profile_no_pii_ck`) rejects a profile blob carrying `birthData`, `responses`, `transcript` and friends, so a future caller cannot smuggle session input into the column that four other services read.
- **The profile is never logged, never traced, never put on an event.** `BlueprintSpanAttributes` in `tracing.ts` is a closed type: every field is an id, a count, a duration or an enum. Adding to it is a deliberate act, visible in a diff.
- Error messages carry no session content — there is a test for that.
- An export lists crewmates by id and role, never by profile. A crewmate consented to being in a crew, not to being in someone else's data export.

## Deletion cascades — §7.2

`erase()` is a hard delete: not a soft delete, not a tombstone, not an anonymisation. One transaction, and afterwards no row in this schema references the user.

| What                                    | Why it is easy to miss                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mentor_matches` on **both** columns    | Deleting only `student_id` leaves the user on other people's shortlists           |
| `match_runs`                            | Keyed by user; they hold crew ids and integers only, so deleting them is complete |
| `crew_members`                          | —                                                                                 |
| `blueprints`                            | —                                                                                 |
| Crews the departure emptied             | Otherwise a crew of zero still appears in matching and still carries a name       |
| `profiles.blueprint_id` in svc-identity | Cleared by **event** — §2 forbids writing another service's tables                |

Idempotent: erasing twice removes nothing the second time and publishes once. A user can onboard again afterwards and gets a genuinely new Blueprint, not a resurrected one.

---

## Database constraints as a backstop

The service checks these; the database enforces them regardless.

| Constraint                       | What it catches                                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blueprints_profile_no_pii_ck`   | **session input smuggled into the profile blob**, where it would then be exported everywhere |
| `blueprints_profile_shape_ck`    | a profile missing an axis, failing later as an unreadable score inside a match run           |
| `blueprints_user_idx` (unique)   | two Blueprints per account — "which one is you" resolved by whichever row was read first     |
| `crew_members_user_idx` (unique) | a retried placement putting someone in two crews                                             |
| `mentor_matches_pair_idx`        | a re-run stacking a duplicate row that appears twice in one shortlist                        |
| `mentor_matches_not_self_ck`     | a self-match scoring maximally on every affinity axis by construction                        |
| `crews_capacity_positive_ck`     | a capacity-0 crew that can never accept the member it was formed for                         |

## §13 socket — placement contention at Drop I

**This is the thing most likely to break §7.2's "under 3 minutes", and it is not the code being slow.**

Every `onboard()` call reads _every_ open crew in the season (`loadCandidates`) and then writes a `crew_members` row, all inside one `serializable` transaction. That is precisely the read-write overlap `serializable` exists to detect, which is correct — it is what stops two people both joining the last seat in a crew. The cost is that concurrent onboarding transactions abort and retry each other.

At normal load that is invisible: `maxAttempts: 5` with jittered backoff absorbs it, and the whole call runs in well under a second.

The problem is **Drop I is the Blueprint drop** (§11) — the one moment in the launch sequence when a large number of people onboard simultaneously, which is exactly when every transaction is contending over the same small set of crews. The failure mode is not a slow query; it is retry storms and `blueprint.onboarding` transactions exhausting their attempts. The three minutes would be spent in backoff, not in code.

Two compounding factors, both currently fine and both scaling badly:

- `loadCandidates` is an unbounded aggregate over all crews in the season. Fine at hundreds; a full scan at hundreds of thousands — inside the serializable transaction, which widens the conflict window in proportion.
- The conflict window covers the engine-independent part of onboarding only (the engine call is deliberately outside the transaction), but it still spans the candidate scan, the placement insert and the mentor shortlist write.

**Sockets, in the order they would be fitted:**

1. **Bound the candidate set** — filter to open, recent, in-season crews with a supporting index, and cap the number scored. Placement quality barely moves; the conflict window shrinks by orders of magnitude. Determinism is preserved as long as the bound is itself deterministic (an `ORDER BY` plus `LIMIT`, never a sample).
2. **Serialise placement per candidate crew** rather than per transaction — take the crew row lock first and drop to `read committed`, the pattern `packages/db`'s `transaction()` documents for exactly this case. Transactions then queue on a lock instead of aborting one another.
3. **Queue placement behind the reveal.** The user-visible flow is signup → session → reveal; crew placement does not have to be synchronous with it. Making placement a job would take it off the 3-minute path entirely and remove the spike from the request path.

None of this is needed for correctness today, and none of it is speculative work worth doing before there is load to measure. It is written down because the moment it matters is a launch, and a launch is the worst time to discover it.

## Not in this feature

- **The share card** (`blueprint.card`) — 1080×1350 / 1200×630 server-side render via satori/resvg. Separate feature. `blueprints.card_asset_url` is the socket and is null until it lands.
- On-chain rank attestations (`blueprint.attestations`, §19).
- Crew vaults (§33) — Phase 5P, and the money lives in the ledger when it arrives.

## Shared-package changes in this PR

§15.2 says a shared-package change should be its own PR first. Flagging these rather than burying them:

- `packages/contracts/src/blueprint.ts` — **new.** The profile schema and the export/erase envelopes. §7.1 names three read-only downstream consumers of `blueprints.profile` (svc-trade, svc-academy, svc-agents); they read it through here and never import this service.
- `packages/events/src/catalog.ts` — three events added. The bus validates against the catalog, so this is unavoidable rather than optional.
- `packages/auth/src/scopes.ts` — `blueprint:read` / `blueprint:write`, plus the implication. `Scope` is a closed union; without these the router would have to authorise Blueprint access on an unrelated module's scope.

---

## Running it

```bash
docker compose up -d
pnpm --filter @intafaced/svc-blueprint db:migrate
pnpm --filter @intafaced/svc-blueprint test
pnpm scan:brand
```

## Tests

The matching heuristics are pure functions, tested exhaustively without a database — determinism under 200 repeated runs and under permutation of the candidate list, monotonicity, integer range across every crew size, tie-breaking, and the threshold that keeps someone out of a crew of clones.

The service paths run against real Postgres, because the parts most likely to hide a bug are the transaction boundaries: the placement that must not overfill a crew, and the erasure that must not leave a row behind. Neither is observable against a fake. The suite skips itself when Postgres is unreachable rather than failing.

Failure branches covered: an unavailable engine (nothing written, nothing announced, no session content in the error), a full crew rejecting a join, five concurrent joins against two seats, erasing a user who never onboarded, erasing twice, and onboarding again after erasure.
