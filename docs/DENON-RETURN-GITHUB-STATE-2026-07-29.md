# Denon return — GitHub state (2026-07-29)

Nitro was AFK. Agents finished open Nitro work onto **main**. **Do not rebuild these.**

## On `main` this session (squash-merged, CI green)

| PR | What |
| --- | --- |
| #99 | CI requires money-suite Postgres (no silent skip) |
| #89 | svc-pay `/trpc` mount proof + honest pay.gateway tracker |
| #98 | Stream A Phase 1 plan + terminal honesty bar |
| #91 | svc-ws public trade tape from `orderFilled` |
| #93 | svc-identity WebAuthn registration + assertion (§9) |
| #94 | svc-token live `stake` / `unstake` / epoch mint (+ keeps #97 governance) |
| #97 | token.governance (earlier) |
| #96 | vendor residual wallet mass-credit + CORS |
| #87 / #90 | convert + protocol AMM |

**Main tip:** re-check with `git fetch && git log origin/main -1`.

## Stream split (still true)

- **Nitro Stream A** = app surface (`feat/app-*`, issue #83, `docs/NITRO-STREAM-A-CLAIM.md`)
- **Denon** = spine (`services/`, packages money paths, edge, compose, Java)

## Before you start a feature

```bash
gh pr list --state open
pnpm tracker ready   # after pull main
```

Open PRs + tracker `wip`/`done` on **main** are the claim board. Telegram is optional.

## Safe free work

Anything in `pnpm tracker ready` that is **not** listed above and has **no** open PR.

Money-enum / multi-asset / licence Priority-1 (chart path, MySQL connector) remain **your** product calls.
