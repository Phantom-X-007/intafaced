/**
 * COPY RENDERING FOR OUT-OF-APP CHANNELS.
 *
 * The inbox stores keys, not sentences — `title_key`, `body_key`, `params` —
 * and the web client renders them. An email has no client, so somebody has to
 * render it, and that somebody is this file, from the SAME catalog
 * (`@intafaced/i18n`).
 *
 * That is not a convenience. It is the only arrangement in which an email
 * cannot say something a screen could not:
 *
 *   · Every string is a catalog key, so §9's "keyed from day one" holds for
 *     channels that ship no UI.
 *   · The catalog is scanned by `pnpm scan:brand`, so §0.7 holds for copy that
 *     leaves the platform — which is precisely where a partner's name would
 *     otherwise slip in, because nobody reviews an email template.
 *   · A translation added for the web is instantly live on email and SMS. No
 *     second catalogue to drift.
 *
 * Mode is `prod` deliberately: a missing key must not throw and kill a margin
 * call. It falls back to English, reports, and — if the key exists nowhere —
 * renders the key itself, which is ugly, greppable, and not blank. The gate that
 * stops that reaching a user is a test over the kinds this service emits, not a
 * runtime exception on the delivery path.

 * stamped Arabic, and a gateway that honours the field would mirror the layout
 * right-to-left around left-to-right words — on a margin call, which is the
 * worst message we send to be hard to read.
 *
 * Asking `hasCatalog` instead of `isSupportedLocale` closes that. It is also
 * self-maintaining: the day an Arabic catalog lands, this returns `'ar'` again
 * with no code change here, which is the "translation files, not refactors"
 * promise in §9 actually holding.
