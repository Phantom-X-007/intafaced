/**
 * THE COPY-SCAN, FROM THE INSIDE (§7.2, Doctrine §0.7).
 *
 *   "The onboarding intelligence is the … Neural Engine consumed as an internal
 *    service. User-facing copy references only: Identity Blueprint, Sovereign
 *    Intelligence, Neural Engine. No third-party system names anywhere in UI,
 *    API responses, or docs shipped to users."
 *
 * §7.2 makes an automated copy-scan an exit criterion. `pnpm scan:brand` runs
 * repo-wide in CI; this test runs the same rule against this package as part of
 * its own suite, so a violation fails the service's tests rather than waiting
 * for a separate CI step someone can be tempted to skip.
 *
 * ── Why it reads the scanner instead of listing names ───────────────────────
 * The vocabulary is extracted from `tooling/ci/brand-scan.mjs` at runtime, not
 * duplicated here. Two reasons, and the second is the real one:
 *
 *   1. A name added to the scanner is enforced here immediately, with no second
 *      list to remember to update.
 *
 *   2. **This file does not contain a single forbidden name.** A test that
 *      hard-coded the vendor names to search for would itself be a file
 *      containing them — in the one package where §0.7 says they must never
 *      appear, and in a file the repo-wide scanner also reads. The test would
 *      fail the rule it exists to enforce.
 *
 * ── Why it is stricter than the repo scan ───────────────────────────────────
 * `brand-scan.mjs` skips `drizzle/` directories and does not scan `.sql`. This
 * package's migrations are prose-heavy and are exactly where an engineer would
 * naturally write the vendor's name while explaining what the engine is. So
 * this test scans them too.

 * a full scan as a side effect. Reading the one declaration is cheaper, and the
 * test below asserts the extraction actually found something — a refactor that
 * moves or renames that array fails loudly instead of silently vacuously
