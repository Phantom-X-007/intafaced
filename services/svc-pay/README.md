# svc-pay

The payments core (§6.1). Merchants, the payment lifecycle, settlement into the ledger, and the `RailAdapter` interface every external rail sits behind.

**What it is NOT:** it does not hold balances (the ledger does), it does not choose between rails (smart routing is its own feature), and it does not know the name of a single payment processor. Every rail — the two here and every one that comes later — is an implementation of one interface, and `src/rails/conformance.ts` is what keeps that true.

**On tip today:** gateway mode, rails (`crypto-native`, `card-sandbox`, absent `bank-payout`), public REST + webhooks, PayFac **sub-merchant trees + area fence on money paths** ([below](#payfac--sub-merchant-trees-61)), subscriptions as **crypto invoice-and-watch product-complete** (mandate � due � invoice � capture settle � cancel immediate; card path refuses `pay.mandate_rail_absent`; bounded dunning � `arrears` stall; pre-charge notify sealed as �13 `socket.pay-precharge-notify` with Ready `subscription.productReady`  never invents `notified:true`), destination shape refuse (EVM + IBAN) before hold, G3 settlement release, G4 suspend-safe payout hold, **PSP digital KYB** (`kyb.submit` / `kyb.decide` under `admin:compliance` + append-only KYB/pricing histories; no third-party money lib  D-S-10).
**On tip for pay.fraud (D26-P1-P5):** scoring + review queue + dispute **case** mechanism (`fraud.*` tRPC); chargeback ledger recipes refuse-closed via named �13 `socket.pay-chargeback-ledger-wire` (recipes exist in ledger-client  not posted from svc-pay). List content Class X.
**Still separate / residual:** smart routing (no invent costs/approval rates), commerce plugins, live card charge-against-mandate + real pre-charge delivery (`socket.psp-partners` / `socket.pay-precharge-notify`), IFSC bank dest without partner table, `pay:*` grant path (Nitro DIRECTION �8.4), `kybStatus` money-gate (pay.gateway  sequenced after approver), card acquiring (`socket.psp-partners`), durable disputes table + owner sign-off to close the chargeback ledger socket.

## The lifecycle

```
created ──authorize──▶ authorized ──capture──▶ captured ──settle──▶ settled
   │                        │                      │                   │
   └──────▶ failed ◀────────┘                      └──refund──▶ refunded ◀──refund──┘
```

`payment_events` is the append-only state history. Every transition appends a row; **nothing is ever overwritten**, and the database enforces that with a trigger rather than trusting the application. `payments.status` is a projection of that log, and the captured and refunded totals are summed from it — there is deliberately no `captured_amount` column, because a running total beside an event log is a second source of truth for money.

Where value actually is, at each stage:

| Stage        | Where the money is                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `created`    | Nowhere. Nothing has moved.                                                                                  |
| `authorized` | Nowhere in the book. A promise (card) or a confirmed on-chain transfer at an address we control (crypto).    |
| `captured`   | `pay:clearing:<merchantId>` in the ledger. Ours to hold, the merchant's to receive, not yet theirs to spend. |
| `settled`    | The merchant's own `available` balance, minus the fee.                                                       |
| `refunded`   | Back out through the rail boundary it came in on.                                                            |

## API

Internal tRPC (`src/router.ts`). Money is a **decimal string** in both directions; the input schema rejects a JSON number.

| Procedure               | Scope         | Input                                                                                                    | Output                                           |

| `settlement.payout`     | `pay:payout`  | `{ settlementId, railId, destination }` — dest must match rail (EVM/IBAN)                                | `Settlement`                                     |

| `settlement.release`    | `pay:write`   | `{ settlementId, reason }` — unstick pending freeze; **no ledger move**                                  | `Settlement`                                     |
| `merchantState.set`     | `admin:write` | `{ merchantId, to, reason, confirmOperatorId }` — MFA + distinct confirmer; missing/same confirm refuses | `{ changed, status, event, confirmOperatorId }`  |

Refunds and payouts carry their own scopes. Taking a payment and sending money back out are not the same authority. Bad destinations refuse as `pay.invalid_destination_ref` / `pay.destination_kind_mismatch` **before** any hold.

**HTTP:** `POST /webhooks/:railId` (public, signature-authenticated), `GET /health`, `GET /ready`, hosted checkout `GET /checkout?token=` / `GET /pay/link/:token` (public HTML; browser via edge `/api/pay/checkout?token=`).

### User money in and out

Everything above is **merchant** money — a third party pays a merchant. These are the other half: a **user's own** balance entering and leaving the book.

| Procedure            | Scope            | Input                                                 | Output          |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `deposit.credit`     | `admin:treasury` | `{ userId, assetId, amount, railId, railRef }`        | `Deposit`       |
| `withdrawal.create`  | `trade:withdraw` | `{ assetId, amount, railId, destination, clientRef }` | `Withdrawal`    |
| `withdrawal.get`     | `trade:read`     | `{ withdrawalId }`                                    | `Withdrawal`    |
| `withdrawal.mine`    | `trade:read`     | `{ limit? }`                                          | `Withdrawal[]`  |
| `withdrawal.balance` | `ledger:read`    | `{ assetId }`                                         | `{ available }` |

**Why these live here.** Value entering the book must come from a rail and value leaving goes out through one; the `RailAdapter` interface, the registry and both v1 adapters are in this service. The alternative was a second service learning about rails, or a money path with no rail behind it — which is a money path reconciliation has nothing to check against.

**Why the withdrawal is not in svc-trade.** `services/svc-trade/src/router.ts` says `trade:withdraw` "appears nowhere here, deliberately: it is an INTERACTIVE_ONLY scope that no API key may hold, which is what protects a leaked bot key from moving value off the platform." That reasoning is about the **surface**, not about where the scope lives — svc-trade is the exchange API that bots hit with long-lived keys. It is respected rather than worked around: the withdrawal lives where the rails live, and svc-trade stays a pure exchange API.

#### `deposit.credit` — operator-credentialed, never user-facing

A user who can call the thing that credits their own balance does not need to deposit. So:

- **`admin:treasury`**, which is in `INTERACTIVE_ONLY_SCOPES`. Both halves of that protection apply for free: a long-lived API key may **never** hold it, and a session without 2FA may not exercise it. `pay:write` would have let any merchant credit any user; `admin:write` is broad and not interactive-only.
- **`creditedBy` comes from the token**, never the body. Every unit of value entering this way names the operator who asserted it arrived.
- **Only rails on `PAY_OPERATOR_CREDIT_RAILS`** (blank refuses; owner may set `card-sandbox` explicitly). A hand-typed `crypto-native` credit would move `railBoundary('crypto-native')` away from the chain balance it mirrors, and reconciliation would report a discrepancy that is really a typo. Misconfiguring it fails at **boot**, not at request time.
- **No jurisdiction guard, and no tier check on the payee.** The matrix judges the user being served, and the principal here is an operator who is not the beneficiary — checking their tier measures the wrong person. And money that has already reached a rail must always be bookable: refusing to credit an unverified user does not undo their payment, it strands it at the boundary. The gate belongs on what a balance can **do**, not on being allowed to receive one.

#### `withdrawal.create` — the interactive path off the platform

- **`trade:withdraw`**, INTERACTIVE_ONLY: no API key may hold it, and `requireScope` refuses a session that has not passed 2FA. A normal session does not carry it at all — `auth.stepUp` in svc-identity mints the five-minute token that does.
- **`{ module: 'ledger' }`, not `{ module: 'pay' }`.** The matrix rule governing a user moving their own custodial balance is the rule for the module that **holds** it, and the ledger holds it (`custodial: true`, `OPEN_BASIC`). `pay`'s `full` tier governs merchant acquiring — third-party card money — a different risk and a different subject. Gating a withdrawal above the tier that admitted the value would build a one-way door: verified enough to deposit and trade, not verified enough to leave.
- **`clientRef` is required, not optional.** A timed-out request retried without one opens a second withdrawal, and a second withdrawal is a second debit. `clientOrderId` is merely recommended on an order because a duplicate order can be cancelled; there is no cancelling a payout.
- **The account comes from the token.** There is no `userId` input, so there is nothing to forge.

### Which rails are real — read this before believing a `sent`

| rail            | `mode`                      | counterparty                                                                                  | what a `payout` returns                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `card-sandbox`  | `sandbox`, permanently      | a `Map` in `card-sandbox.ts`                                                                  | `po_<settlementId>` — a string this file invented             |
| `crypto-native` | derived from the chain port | `EvmLiveChain` when configured; else `MemoryChain` (dev) / `UnconfiguredChain` (staging/prod) | a real `txHash` on a live chain; `0xout…` / refusal otherwise |
| `bank-payout`   | `absent`, permanently       | nothing — sponsor bank / licence is a commercial socket                                       | never succeeds; `pay.rail_not_live` before any hold           |

**Live crypto-native** is wired when all of these are set:

```bash
PAY_CRYPTO_RPC_URL=…          # archive-capable JSON-RPC
PAY_CRYPTO_CHAIN_ID=…
PAY_CRYPTO_DEPOSIT_MNEMONIC=… # HD acceptance addresses (not the hot wallet)
PAY_CRYPTO_HOT_WALLET_KEY=0x… # outbound signing key
PAY_CRYPTO_ASSETS=ETH:native  # or ETH:native,USDT:0x…:6
```

That builds `EvmLiveChain` (`src/rails/evm-chain.ts`, `posture: 'live'`), starts the in-process watcher that POSTs signed webhooks with `PAY_CRYPTO_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and makes `crypto-native` a live rail. Staging/prod then **omit** `card-sandbox` by default (`shouldRegisterCardSandbox`) so the boot posture gate can pass without `PAY_ALLOW_SANDBOX_RAILS`.

**Why sandbox gates still matter.** A withdrawal settled against a sandbox rail debits the user's real ledger balance, writes a fabricated reference into `withdrawals.rail_ref`, and answers `status: 'sent'`. The books still balance — only custody reconciliation can see the lie.

**The two gates** (`src/rails/posture.ts`):

1. **Boot.** `APP_ENV` of `staging` or `prod` with any sandbox rail registered **refuses to start**, unless `PAY_ALLOW_SANDBOX_RAILS=true` says so by name (logged loudly on every boot).
2. **Runtime.** `payout` and `refund` re-check at the call site, **before** the ledger moves — `withdrawal.create` refuses with `pay.rail_not_live` before a row or a hold exists.

`dev` and `test` without live config keep `MemoryChain` + `card-sandbox` as the fixture.

**What the owner must still obtain for production money:**

- A **production** (or public testnet) RPC, not only compose anvil — anvil proves the wiring; it is not a chain decision (`docs/decisions/local-dev-chain.md`).
- Custody of the hot wallet / deposit mnemonic outside the repo (HSM or signing service preferred; the in-process key is the v1 minimum).
- Live boot wires `PostgresBroadcastStore` (`pay.crypto_broadcasts`, migration 0004 + `signed_raw` in 0012) for multi-replica claim→putSigned→sendRaw→put. `MemoryBroadcastStore` remains the unit/local default when no store is passed to `defaultChainFor` in `dev`/`test`. staging/prod live chain **refuses to build** without a store — two replicas on the in-memory journal can double-send. DIRECTION §3.1 / D26-P1-P9: the signed raw is journalled **before** `eth_sendRawTransaction`; crash-resume rebroadcasts the identical payload (`claim` → `resume`) instead of signing a second spend. Put-before-receipt still closes the wait-for-inclusion window.
- Live boot also wires `PostgresChainWatcherCursorStore` (`pay.chain_watcher_cursors`, migration 0017) so the in-process watcher persists last-seen (block, tx hash, log index). A crash that re-drains the same finalization does not POST a second credit. No mnemonic → no live chain → watcher never starts; `/pay` deposits stay a named refuse, not an invented inbound.
- **Card acquiring** — sponsor bank / BIN. Still a §13 commercial socket; `card-sandbox` is never it.

`/ready` and `railHealth` both carry `mode` now, because `healthy: true` was accurate and useless — a sandbox is reliably healthy at simulating.

> **Interface mismatch, flagged not papered over.** `RailAdapter.payout` takes a `SettlementInstruction`, which is merchant-shaped — it is the only payout shape §6.1 has. Every adapter uses `settlementId` purely as the payout idempotency key and reads `merchantId` not at all, so a user withdrawal passes its own id and the user id and works correctly. Generalising it to a `PayoutInstruction` is a change to a reviewed interface plus its conformance kit, so it belongs in its own PR (§15.2).

### PayFac — sub-merchant trees (§6.1)

A merchant may now have children. `merchants.parent_merchant_id` is the tree (NULL = top of its own tree, which is what every merchant already was), and `merchants.settling_party` is the spec's one hard design constraint made a column rather than an assumption — `docs/SPEC-PAY-VERTICALS-2026-08-02.md` §2: _"model the sub-merchant relationship so the settling party is a field, not an assumption."_

**This slice moves no value.** No ledger client, no recipe, no balance, no amount. A sub-merchant is a sovereign account exactly as a merchant is; the tree decides **who may ask**, never where money sits (Doctrine §0.6).

| Procedure                       | Scope       | Input                                                    | Output              |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `submerchant.create`            | `pay:write` | `{ parentMerchantId, userId, pricing: { feeBps }, … }`   | `SubMerchant`       |
| `submerchant.list`              | `pay:read`  | `{ merchantId, limit? }`                                 | `SubMerchant[]`     |
| `submerchant.get`               | `pay:read`  | `{ merchantId }`                                         | `SubMerchant`       |
| `submerchantPermission.grant`   | `pay:write` | `{ granteeMerchantId, subjectMerchantId, area, reason }` | `PermissionEvent`   |
| `submerchantPermission.revoke`  | `pay:write` | `{ granteeMerchantId, subjectMerchantId, area, reason }` | `PermissionEvent`   |
| `submerchantPermission.list`    | `pay:read`  | `{ subjectMerchantId }`                                  | `PermissionGrant[]` |
| `submerchantPermission.history` | `pay:read`  | `{ subjectMerchantId, limit? }`                          | `PermissionEvent[]` |
| `submerchantPermission.areas`   | `pay:read`  | –                                                        | the area vocabulary |

#### The two checks, which are not the same check

1. **Scope** — structural and absolute. The caller's merchant node must be an ancestor of the subject, or the subject itself. **No grant widens this.** A parent cannot read a sibling subtree, a child cannot read upward, and two payfacs are invisible to each other.
2. **Area** — a permission, and only for a subject that is not the caller itself. A merchant holds every area over its **own** node. Over a descendant it holds an area only if it is the **root** of that tree (the node with the platform relationship, which §2 of the spec makes liable for everyone beneath it), or a live grant says so.

**The acting node comes from the token.** There is no `actorMerchantId` on the wire. `pay:write` is a merchant's own scope held by every merchant on the platform, so a merchant node taken from a request body would leave the fence working perfectly while measuring the wrong actor.

**Delegation flows down, and only what you hold.** A non-root node cannot self-grant, cannot grant laterally (one child never gets authority over another), and cannot grant an area it was not given. Onboarding writes exactly two default areas to each intermediate ancestor — `merchant.profile` and `submerchant`, visibility only. **No value-shaped area is held by any non-root node until somebody grants it by name and says why.**

**`pay.merchant_permission_events` is append-only**, enforced by a trigger. A revoke is a new row. "Who could refund this sub-merchant's payments on the 3rd" is argued from in a dispute, and an editable answer is not evidence.

#### The "14 permission areas" — said out loud

The tracker row is titled _"PayFac mode — sub-merchant trees, 14 permission areas"_. **That list has never existed.** The phrase is one title string copied between `tooling/tracker/features.mjs`, `tooling/coverage.yaml`, `INTAFACED_DEFINITIVE_BUILD.md` and three board renders derived from them; `docs/PAY-LANE-HARVEST-AND-BUILD-PLAN-2026-08-08.md` §2 found the same thing independently and §6.3 puts _"enumerate them, or drop the claim from the title"_ on the owner's list.

So this ships the **mechanism**, and `PERMISSION_AREAS` in `src/submerchants.ts` is **eleven** areas — every one that names a surface this service actually has: `merchant.profile`, `checkout.profile`, `payment.link`, `payment`, `payment.refund`, `settlement`, `settlement.payout`, `webhook`, `kyb`, `submerchant`, `permission`. Padding the list to hit a number in a title would be inventing product law inside an implementation. `area` is stored as text, so the twelfth is a one-line change and no migration.

#### What is deliberately NOT here

- **Settling a sub-merchant out of our account.** `settlingParty` accepts `'self'` only and refuses everything else by name (`pay.submerchant_settling_party_unsupported`). That is acquiring — a sponsor bank and an acquiring BIN, which `docs/SPEC-PAY-VERTICALS-2026-08-02.md` §8 puts on the owner's list and `socket.psp-partners` tracks. The column exists so adopting a partner later is configuration rather than a rewrite; it is not a switch this service can throw.
- **Areas on the gateway surface (W5).** Money and merchant procedures in `router.ts` / `public-rest.ts` call `assertMerchantAreaAccess` with the matching area (`payment`, `payment.refund`, `settlement`, `settlement.payout`, `payment.link`, `webhook`, `kyb`, …). Self still holds every area. A parent without a grant is `pay.submerchant_permission_denied`; a stranger stays `pay.merchant_forbidden`. Pins: `merchant-ownership.test.ts`.
- **Split payments and sub-merchant fee routing.** Ledger recipes, Class M, and the owner's sign-off (`docs/PAY-LANE-HARVEST-AND-BUILD-PLAN-2026-08-08.md` §6.4).
- **Sub-merchant KYB workflow and document capture.** Top-level merchant digital KYB (submit + operator decide + history) ships under `kyb.*` / mig 0013; document-capture vendor integration and sub-merchant KYB remain residual. Card acquiring stays `socket.psp-partners`.

### Error codes

`pay.submerchant_out_of_scope` and `pay.submerchant_permission_denied` map to **FORBIDDEN**, and they are different questions on purpose: the first says the node is not yours to look at, the second says it is yours to look at and not yours to act on. `pay.submerchant_user_already_merchant` maps to **CONFLICT** — one merchant per sovereign account is a database rule and nothing the caller resends fixes it. `pay.submerchant_cycle` is **CONFLICT** rather than a 500 so the message naming the corrupted node survives to an operator.

Also: `pay.submerchant_grant_lateral`, `pay.submerchant_grant_self`, `pay.submerchant_grant_redundant`, `pay.submerchant_revoke_redundant`, `pay.submerchant_area_unknown`, `pay.submerchant_too_deep`, `pay.submerchant_reason_required`, `pay.submerchant_pricing_invalid`, `pay.submerchant_settling_party_unsupported`, `pay.submerchant_not_onboarded`.

`pay.rail_declined`, `pay.rail_failed`, `pay.capture_exceeds_authorized`, `pay.partial_capture_unsupported`, `pay.refund_exceeds_captured`, `pay.refund_in_flight`, `pay.settlement_in_flight`, `pay.settlement_desynced`, `pay.rail_amount_mismatch`, `pay.invalid_transition`, `pay.nothing_to_settle`, `pay.fee_exceeds_gross`, `pay.merchant_pricing_invalid`, `pay.webhook_invalid`, `pay.webhook_unmatched`, `pay.rail_unknown`, `pay.rail_not_creditable`, `pay.deposit_conflict`, `pay.withdrawal_not_found`, `pay.withdrawal_conflict`, `pay.rail_not_live`, `pay.destination_kind_mismatch`.

`pay.destination_kind_mismatch` is refused **before** any ledger hold: a crypto payout cannot name a bank IBAN (and the reverse). Retrying with the same wrong kind never moves money.

`pay.settlement_in_flight` and `pay.settlement_desynced` map to **CONFLICT**. The first refuses a pre-settlement refund while a pending window has frozen the payment (clearing must not be drained under a frozen gross). The second refuses to post a settlement whose live captured−refunded totals no longer match the freeze — better a stuck pending row than a ledger entry funded by someone else's capture.

`pay.deposit_conflict` and `pay.withdrawal_conflict` map to **CONFLICT**, never BAD_REQUEST: the caller reused a business key for different numbers, and nothing they resend fixes it.

`pay.rail_not_live` maps to **SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE**, never INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR. The request was well-formed; the platform has no rail that would actually move the money. A 500 reads as "try again", and this is the one condition retrying can never fix.

## Events

### `payment_events` — the internal append-only history

This is the state history §6.1 requires, and it is the truth this service reasons from. Ordered by `seq` (a `bigserial`), not by `ts`: every event appended inside one transaction shares a transaction timestamp, and a history that cannot order a capture against a refund is not a history.

| Event                 | Appended when                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `created`             | A payment row exists. Nothing has moved.                                                                                    |
| `rail.authorize`      | A rail answered an authorization request (ok or not).                                                                       |
| `rail.pending`        | The rail took the request but has not completed it — on `crypto-native`, the transfer has not landed or is not deep enough. |
| `authorized`          | The rail authorized. The amount recorded is what the RAIL authorized.                                                       |
| `rail.capture`        | A rail answered a capture request.                                                                                          |
| `captured`            | Value entered the book. Carries the ledger transaction id.                                                                  |
| `refund.posted`       | The merchant has been debited and a refund is about to be sent.                                                             |
| `rail.refund`         | The rail answered the refund request.                                                                                       |
| `refunded`            | The refund left the rail.                                                                                                   |
| `refund.reversed`     | The rail refused; the ledger posting was reversed.                                                                          |
| `settlement.included` | The payment is frozen into a settlement window.                                                                             |
| `settled`             | The window posted to the merchant's ledger account.                                                                         |
| `failed`              | The rail declined, or a failure webhook arrived.                                                                            |
| `webhook.<type>`      | A verified rail delivery. Carries `rail_event_id`, which is **unique** — this is the dedupe.                                |

### NATS

**svc-pay publishes no NATS subjects yet.** Not an oversight: the bus is a contract, and §15.2 / AGENT_PROTOCOL §2 require a `packages/events` catalog PR — reviewed on its own — before a producer emits anything. `intafaced.pay.payment.captured` and `intafaced.pay.settlement.completed` are the two consumers will want; they land in the catalog first.

**Consumes:** nothing.

## Ledger

Every value movement is a recipe. This service holds no balance of any kind (Doctrine §0.6).

| Recipe                 | Reason code               | Accounts                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `paymentCapture`       | `payment.captured`        | rail boundary → `pay:clearing:<merchantId>`                            |
| `merchantSettlement`   | `pay.settled`             | `pay:clearing:<merchantId>` → merchant available + `houseFees('pay')`  |
| `paymentRefund`        | `payment.refunded`        | clearing (pre-settlement) or merchant available (post) → rail boundary |
| `paymentRefundReverse` | `payment.refund.reversed` | rail boundary → back where the refund came from                        |
| `withdrawHold`         | `withdraw.held`           | available → purpose-keyed hold (payout / withdrawal in flight)         |
| `withdrawSettle`       | `withdraw.settled`        | hold → rail boundary (completed)                                       |
| `withdrawReverse`      | `withdraw.reversed`       | hold → available (refused)                                             |
| `deposit`              | `deposit.credited`        | rail boundary → user available                                         |

The three `withdraw*` recipes serve **both** outbound paths — a merchant payout keyed on `<settlementId>:<attempt>`, and a user withdrawal keyed on `<withdrawalId>:<attempt>`. Same shape, same reasoning, one set of recipes.

For D26-P1-P4, `settlement-ledger.ts` makes that constraint executable: both
`bank` and `crypto` settlement destinations produce only the existing
`withdrawHold` → `withdrawSettle` / `withdrawReverse` requests. Rail adapters
own the destination difference; svc-pay does not assemble entries or invent a
bank-specific book. `bank-payout` remains `absent` and refuses before the hold
until the Class X sponsor-bank socket exists, while configured `crypto-native`
can complete the same recipe plan against a real chain.

**`merchantClearing(merchantId, assetId)`** is a new account constructor: a `module`-owned account per merchant, per asset. It answers "a payment was captured but not settled — whose funds are those?" as a balance rather than an investigation. `sum(merchantClearing(m))` is exactly what svc-pay owes merchant `m` right now, readable from the ledger without touching a single svc-pay table — which is what makes reconciliation between the two meaningful.

### Idempotency keys — all business keys, never random

| Key                                                       | Governs                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `payment.capture:<paymentId>`                             | A payment is captured once, however many times the webhook is delivered.                                                                   |
| `payment.refund:<paymentId>:<refundId>`                   | One refund, one posting. Namespaced by payment so merchant ids do not collide across payments. `<refundId>` defaults to `<paymentId>:<n>`. |
| `payment.refund.reverse:<paymentId>:<refundId>`           | The reversal of that refund.                                                                                                               |
| `settlement:<merchantId>:<window>:<assetId>`              | A window settles once, per asset.                                                                                                          |
| `withdraw.hold\|settle\|reverse:<settlementId>:<attempt>` | One merchant payout attempt.                                                                                                               |
| `withdraw.hold\|settle\|reverse:<withdrawalId>:<attempt>` | One user withdrawal attempt.                                                                                                               |
| `deposit:<rail>:<railRef>`                                | A rail reference is credited once, however often it is redelivered.                                                                        |

> **Why the asset is in the settlement key.** §6.1's settlement is keyed on merchant and window. A merchant taking USDT and BTC on the same day has two settlements, and without the asset in the key the second would find the first's transaction, return it, and strand a whole currency's takings in clearing. The `settlements` table carries an `asset_id` column for the same reason: `gross`/`fees`/`net` are meaningless without one.

### Order of operations, and whose funds are stranded

The direction of the money decides the order:

- **Inbound (capture):** the rail moves first, the ledger books second. We only book value we know has arrived. A crash in between leaves money captured at the rail and not yet in the book — the classic. Nothing is lost: both halves are keyed on the payment id, so re-running finishes the job.
- **Outbound (refund, payout):** the ledger moves first, the rail second. The merchant must be shown to have the money before any of it goes somewhere irreversible; a post-settlement refund they cannot cover fails at the ledger, before the rail is asked. A crash in between leaves the book correct and only the status projection behind. If the rail then refuses, the ledger posting is reversed in the same call.

A refund whose id is already in flight is **refused**, not re-sent. Live crypto receives a durable `refundId` (M226-02) so a process restart reuses the same outbound broadcast key; card-sandbox ignores it. The **service** still refuses re-entry while `refund.posted` has no terminal `refunded` / `refund.reversed` — "send it again and hope" is how one refund becomes two on a rail that cannot dedupe.

### User money: whose funds are stranded, per branch

**Deposit** (inbound — the rail already moved, in the real world):

| Crash point                  | Whose funds, and where                                            | Recovery                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Before the claim row commits | Nobody's in the book. Value sits at the rail with no record here. | Re-run. Nothing was recorded, so nothing is inconsistent.                     |
| Claimed, not yet booked      | **The user's** — at the rail, not in the book. Row is `pending`.  | Re-run the same `(rail, railRef)`; `deposits_status_idx` lists exactly these. |
| Booked, row not flipped      | Nobody's. The user has their money; the row is one status behind. | Re-run: the ledger key is identical, so the post is a no-op.                  |

**Withdrawal** (outbound — the ledger moves first):

| Crash point                  | Whose funds, and where                                                                                                | Recovery                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Before the hold posts        | Nobody's. The balance is untouched.                                                                                   | Re-run on the same `clientRef`.                                                                                                                                 |
| Insufficient funds           | Nobody's. Nothing moved, and it failed **before** a rail was asked.                                                   | The row records `ledger.insufficient_funds`.                                                                                                                    |
| **Held, rail never asked**   | **The user's, immobilised** — out of `available`, in `withdraw:<id>:<attempt>`. The only branch where value is stuck. | Re-run on the same `clientRef`: the hold key is identical so it moves nothing, and the rail is then asked. `withdrawals_status_idx` lists everything in `held`. |
| Rail refused                 | Nobody's. Reversed to `available` **in the same call**, `attempts` advances.                                          | None needed. Retrying takes a fresh hold key.                                                                                                                   |
| Rail sent, settle not posted | Nobody's is lost, but **the platform is short**: the rail paid out and the book still shows a hold.                   | Re-run: the settle posts once, and the rail is not re-asked because its idempotency key is the same string.                                                     |

The one genuinely stuck state is `held`, which is exactly why it is a real status with its own index rather than something inferred.

## Rails

`src/rails/rail-adapter.ts` is the interface, exactly as §6.1 specifies — `id`, `capabilities`, `authorize`, `capture`, `refund`, `payout`, `verifyWebhook` — plus `health()`, taken from the shape `packages/venue-adapter` already uses for liquidity venues.

| Adapter         | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `crypto-native` | **Real.** Accepts on-chain assets and settles them to the ledger. Talks to `CryptoChainPort`, never to a node directly.                                                                                                 |
| `card-sandbox`  | A **mock acquirer**, not a mock adapter. The state machine, decline codes, refund arithmetic, signed webhooks and idempotency are all real; only the counterparty is simulated. It runs the full flow end to end in CI. |

### `crypto-native`: authorize and capture are not what they are on a card

A chain has no auth hold and nothing to complete. So:

- **authorize** means "a transfer to this payment's acceptance address has reached `minConfirmations`". Below the threshold the answer is `pending`, not `authorized` — a shallow transaction can still be reorganised away, and a merchant who ships against one has shipped against nothing.
- **capture** is an accounting act, and it re-reads the chain rather than trusting a decision made minutes ago. A reorg between the two is caught.

It also handles what payers actually do: **underpayment** and **wrong token to the right address** both fail the payment while reporting the address, the transaction and the sender, so the funds are recoverable rather than merely lost. An **overpayment** is booked at what arrived, because booking less would strand the difference.

### Webhook verification

Constant-time, via `crypto.timingSafeEqual`, over the **raw body** signed together with a timestamp. Length is checked separately first, because `timingSafeEqual` throws on a length mismatch and an unhandled exception on a public endpoint is a denial-of-service surface. Non-hex signatures are rejected outright: `Buffer.from('zz','hex')` is empty, and two empty buffers compare equal — a signature of nothing verifying nothing. Stale timestamps are replays. Nothing throws, whatever arrives.

A verified delivery is still shape-checked: an amount that is a JSON number is rejected even when the signature is perfect.

### Adding a rail — the conformance kit (§6.3)

```ts
import { runRailAdapterConformance } from '@intafaced/svc-pay/rails';

runRailAdapterConformance('acme-acquirer', async () => ({
  adapter: new AcmeAcquirerAdapter({ ... }),
  reset: async () => { ... },
  primeAuthorization: async (intent) => { ... },
  signWebhook: (event) => ({ ... }),
  signRaw: (body) => ({ ... }),
  failNext: () => { ... },
  payoutDestination: () => ({ kind: 'bank', ref: '...' }),

**Any future adapter must pass this kit before merge.** It asserts identity and capability declaration, health and staleness, the `RailResult` contract (`ok === (status !== 'failed')`, money is always a bigint, a failure always carries a machine-readable code), authorize/capture/refund/payout idempotency on business keys, refund arithmetic including over-refund across partials, webhook verification against tampering, forged and wrong-length signatures, replay, garbage and correctly-signed-but-malformed payloads, and that rail failures surface as results rather than exceptions and leave nothing half-done.

What the kit asserts is exactly what the core is entitled to assume. That is what makes §6.1's "drop in later as adapters with zero core changes" a testable claim instead of a hope.

## Kill-switch

`module.pay` in the admin console — the module kill-switch beats every other flag (`packages/config/src/flags.ts`). With it off, no procedure in this service serves. `pay.payfac` and `pay.laneA` gate features not built here.

---

## Running it

```bash
pnpm --filter @intafaced/svc-pay db:migrate      # apply, --down to reverse
pnpm --filter @intafaced/svc-pay test            # needs Postgres on :5433; skips cleanly without it
pnpm gate svc-pay
```

Tests run against real Postgres (`postgres://svc_pay:svc_pay@localhost:5433/intafaced`) with `MemoryLedger` as the ledger — legitimate because the ledger conformance suite proves the reference implementation and svc-ledger's Postgres engine behave identically (§4.4). Postgres is real because the payment row / event log / ledger interaction is exactly where a bug would hide, because the append-only guarantee is a database trigger an in-memory fake would quietly not have, and because the deposit and withdrawal idempotency **is** a unique index.

The two Postgres suites bring the schema up under a shared advisory lock and own disjoint tables — vitest runs test files in parallel, and both re-asserting the same CHECK constraints at once deadlocks.

| `PAY_OPERATOR_CREDIT_RAILS` | unset refuses | Rails an operator may credit a deposit on by hand. Owner may set `card-sandbox` explicitly. Widening it is a deliberate operator decision. |
