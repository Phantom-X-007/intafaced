/**
 * svc-market environment.
 *
 * This service self-mounts /trpc, so it must be able to authenticate the edge:
 * every procedure resolves `ctx.principal.userId` into somebody's vendor
 * application, and an unsigned principal header would let a caller apply as, or
 * vet, anyone (docs/decisions/mount-boundary.md).
 *
 * `internalServiceEnvSchema` arrived with Stage 2, for exactly ONE callee:
 * svc-token's `/internal/stake/:userId`, which is how a listing slot knows what
 * the caller's stake tier entitles them to. Stage 1's comment here said it would
 * arrive "when stake-gated slots need token.stakeOf" — this is that.
 *
 * `INTERNAL_SERVICE_SECRET` has no default, so a container started without it
 * dies at import rather than serving slot claims it cannot gate. Its wiring in
 * `docker-compose.apps.yml` is what `tooling/ci/compose-secret-parity.mjs`
 * checks, and the svc-academy block there records why that gate exists.
 *
 * `LEDGER_URL` arrived with market.commerce. Vendors still move no value; only
 * the purchase path posts recipes. `MARKET_HOUSE_COMMISSION_BPS` has NO default —
 * unset means refuse-closed (`market.commission_not_configured`). Setting `0` is
 * an explicit free-commission decision by the owner, not silence.
