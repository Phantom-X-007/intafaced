/**
 * DOCTRINE GATES — one list, run by `pnpm verify` AND by CI.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * ────────────────────
 * `AGENTS.md` and its sibling agent entry file both tell every human and every
 * agent the same thing: run `pnpm verify` before you claim done. That promise
 * is only worth something if `verify` runs what CI runs. Until this file it did
 * not, and the two lists lived in two places that knew nothing about each other:
 *
 *   · the `verify` script in package.json, and
 *   · the eleven hand-written steps in the `gates` job of ci.yml.
 *
 * Two gates had already drifted out of the local list — `scan:dual-book-door-paths`
 * and `scan:test-db` — so an engineer could run `pnpm verify` green, push, and
 * land red on a gate they had no local way of running. That is the exact failure
 * this file removes: CI and verify now consume the SAME array, so a gate cannot
 * be in one and missing from the other.
 *
 * It also removes a duplication. Six of these scans used to run twice per CI
 * run — once in the `gates` job and again inside `dod-gate.mjs` in the `dod`
 * job. `dod-gate.mjs` is now what its name says: the per-service §14 Definition
 * of Done. The repo-wide scans live here.
 *
 * THE THIRD DRIFT, and the one that actually bit
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `i18n-scan.mjs` sat in `tooling/ci/` for weeks wired into nothing at all —
 * not verify, not CI. Nobody deleted it and nobody ran it. So this runner
 * asserts that EVERY `.mjs` in `tooling/ci/` is either in `GATES` below or in
 * `NOT_GATES` with a written reason. A new scan cannot be added and quietly
 * never run: the manifest check fails until someone says which it is.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tooling/ci/gates.mjs          run every gate, report all failures
 *   node tooling/ci/gates.mjs --list   print the gate ids, one per line
