/**
 * WHERE A PRICE IS ALLOWED TO COME FROM.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE FAILURE THIS FILE EXISTS TO MAKE IMPOSSIBLE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `router-quote.ts` is arithmetic: give it venue quotes and it says where the
 * order should go. Until this module existed, the only thing that supplied those
 * quotes was **the caller** — `dex.quote` took a `quotes: []` array over the
 * wire and routed whatever was in it.
 *
 * That is a calculator, not a quote. A UI wired to it renders a price the user
 * can act on, and that price came from nowhere. **A fabricated price in a
 * trading product is worse than an outage**, because an outage stops a user and
 * an invented number encourages one.
 *
 * So a price may enter this service by exactly one road: a `QuoteVenue`, which
 * has to have really fetched a book from something, and has to say when.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS EXTENDS `LiquiditySource` RATHER THAN REPLACING IT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `packages/venue-adapter` already IS the §27 venue fabric — the "own
 * CCXT-class layer" the spec asks for. `LiquiditySource` carries the venue
 * taxonomy (`internal | external-cex | external-dex | amm | otc`), the
 * capability declaration, and `VenueHealth` with `latencyMs` and `lastUpdate`,
 * which is the "latency grading" §27 names. What it did not have, until this
 * PR, was **a single implementation** — it was an interface with nothing behind
 * it, so nothing was ever aggregated.
 *
 * A parallel port here would have split that in two. So `QuoteVenue` IS a
 * `LiquiditySource`, plus the two things svc-dex's own router needs and the
 * Fiat Plane router does not model:
 *
 *   · `settlementCost` — gas. On the Protocol Plane it is not a rounding error;
 *     it is what makes a small order prefer a book and a large one still prefer
 *     a pool.
 *   · `depth()` — the book WITH the moment we read it, so freshness is a fact
 *     about our read rather than a claim by the venue.
 *
 * Everything in venue-adapter (`isRoutable`, `consolidateBook`, `planRoute`)
 * therefore works on these adapters unchanged.
 *
 * ── The property that must not be broken ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `source.ts`'s header states it: the internal book implements the same
 * interface as everyone else, so the router has no notion of "ours" versus
 * "theirs" and cannot quietly favour us. It holds here. Every venue below —
 * on-chain CLOB, our own engine, an external CEX — arrives as the same type and
 * is ranked on effective price alone. There is no internal-preference thumb on
 * the scale anywhere in svc-dex's path.
 *
 * ── No third-party connectivity library ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * §27: _"Our own CCXT-class layer, built past it… **No third-party connectivity
 * library in the money path** — Doctrine 5 applies."_ The `ccxt` package is not
 * a dependency of this workspace and must not become one. Two reasons, and the
 * second is the one that would actually cost a user money:
 *
 *   · Doctrine 5 / §27 — the connectivity layer is ours.
 *   · **CCXT's unified `fetchOrderBook` returns JavaScript numbers.** Every
 *     venue below publishes its book as decimal STRINGS; CCXT parses them to
 *     floats before a caller ever sees them. Routing through it would put a
 *     float in front of every price in the platform, which is the one thing
 *     Doctrine forbids without exception. Reading the venue's own strings costs
 *     one adapter each and keeps the last decimal place.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * CUSTODY
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `LiquiditySource` declares `submit()` because it is also the Fiat Plane's
 * execution port. **Every adapter in svc-dex refuses it.** They declare
 * capabilities `['quote', 'orderbook']` and throw `VenueExecutionRefused` if
 * anything calls `submit`, so an execution path cannot appear here by accident:
 * svc-dex is `custodial: false`, and value moves in the user's own smart account
 * under the user's own key. `custody-scan` enforces the other half.
