/**
 * CROSS-CHECKING — §27's "cross-checked" market data.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A SINGLE VENUE DISAGREEING WITH EVERY OTHER IS A SIGNAL, NOT A PRICE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Sequence checks catch a book that stopped matching the venue's. They cannot
 * catch a book that matches a venue which is itself wrong — a halted market
 * still quoting its last state, a thin venue whose top has been swept and not
 * refilled, a feed a minute behind its own exchange, an outright bad tick.
 *
 * All of those produce a perfectly-formed, perfectly-sequenced, perfectly-fresh
 * book at a price that is not the market. The only thing that catches them is
 * the other venues.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * MEDIAN, NOT MEAN
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The mean is defined by the outlier. One venue quoting ten times the market
 * drags the consensus toward itself, and the check ends up flagging the four
 * healthy venues as the ones that have diverged — precisely inverted.
 *
 * The median is unmoved by any minority. That is the whole reason for it, and it
 * is why `minVenues` is three: with two venues the median is their midpoint,
 * both are equidistant from it, and the arithmetic cannot say which one is
 * wrong. It is not that two is a weak check — it is that two is NO check.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT THIS FUNCTION MUST NEVER DO
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * It does not pick a price. It does not repair a book. It does not substitute a
 * healthy venue for a diverged one — §27's honesty rule is that a bad venue is
 * EXCLUDED AND REPORTED, and silently swapping in another venue's price under
 * the first one's name is the exact failure the rule exists to forbid.
 *
 * It returns a verdict. The caller excludes, reports, and quotes from what is
 * left — or refuses to quote, which is also a valid outcome.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * MIDS, NOT LAST-TRADED PRICES
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The comparison is on mid — `(bestBid + bestAsk) / 2`. Deliberately not the
 * last print: a stale last-trade on a thin venue is the single most misleading
 * number in market data, because it is a REAL trade from a market that has since
 * moved, and it will pass every freshness check we have.
