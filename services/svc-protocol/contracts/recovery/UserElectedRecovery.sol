/**
 * USER-ELECTED RECOVERY — ERC-1271 owner a SmartAccount may set (`socket.social-recovery`).
 *
 * Doctrine (tracker + S-K7 ADR + board S-A1): the platform must NEVER be a guardian.
 * A guardian is a second party who can take the account. This contract has:
 *   · no admin, no operator, no pause, no upgrade
 *   · no hardcoded platform address and no platform quorum
 *   · guardians the USER elects (`addGuardian`) and can revoke (`removeGuardian`)
 *
 * The current `owner` of THIS contract (constructor `owner_`, later rotated by
 * recovery) is the only address that manages the guardian set and the M-of-N
 * threshold. Guardians may propose a new owner; after `delay` seconds AND M
 * distinct guardian calls (or ECDSA signatures over the recovery digest),
 * anyone may rotate `owner`. The sitting owner may `cancelRecovery` before that
 * rotation lands.
 *
 * This contract answers ERC-1271 so a SmartAccount can set it as `owner` and
 * keep signing through the current recovery-owner (EOA or nested ERC-1271).
 * Residual: it is not wired as the default SmartAccount owner — the account
 * still starts with whatever key the factory was given.
 *
 * Not upgradeable. Lose every guardian and the owner key, lose this owner.
