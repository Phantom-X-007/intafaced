/**
 * THE ONE PROPERTY WORTH TESTING HERE.
 *
 * **A price is never invented.** Every test below is a variation on that: fresh
 * data prices, everything else refuses, and a refusal says why. The arithmetic
 * is already covered by `router-quote.test.ts`; what these assert is the part
 * that decides whether a number is allowed to exist at all.
 *
 * The double extends the REAL `MarketDataSource`, so health tracking, the
 * capability declaration and the `submit` refusal under test are the shipped
 * implementations rather than a mock of them.
 *
 * The clock is injected everywhere. A staleness test that slept would be slow
 * and, worse, flaky in the direction that reports a pass — the failure would be
 * "the ceiling did not fire and the test did not notice".
