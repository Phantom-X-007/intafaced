/**
 * ONE-SHOT MIGRATION RUNNER — runs before any service starts.
 *
 * ── Why a one-shot container and not an entrypoint step ─────────────────────
 *
 * Three options were on the table:
 *
 *   (a) an entrypoint step in each service — "migrate, then start". Rejected:
 *       it runs once per REPLICA, so the moment anything scales past one the
 *       same migration races itself. `postgres` gives no cross-connection lock
 *       here, and a half-applied DDL is the one database failure that is not
 *       fixable by restarting.
 *
 *   (b) an init container per service (10 extra containers). Rejected: it is
 *       correct but it spreads one question — "did the schema apply?" — across
 *       ten places to look, and each one needs its own credentials block in
 *       compose. Ten copies of a credential is ten chances to get one wrong.
 *
 *   (c) THIS: a single container that runs every migration and exits, with the
 *       services gated on `condition: service_completed_successfully`.
 *
 * (c) wins because the migrations are genuinely independent. Doctrine §2 gives
 * each service its own schema and forbids cross-schema reads, so no migration
 * here depends on another having run — they can be applied in any order, and
 * the only ordering that matters is "all of them, before anything starts".
 * Compose enforces exactly that, and a failure is one container's logs.
 *
 * Every runner is idempotent (each tracks applied files in its own
 * `<schema>.__migrations` table), so re-running on every `up` is a no-op that
 * costs a second and removes "did you remember to migrate?" from the list of
 * things a clean clone can get wrong.
 *
 * ── Why each service migrates as its OWN role ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `tooling/infra/postgres-init/01-service-schemas.sql` creates one role per
 * service, owning one schema, holding no database-level CREATE. A migration
 * that strays outside its own schema therefore fails HERE, in dev, with a
 * permission error — instead of becoming an architecture violation nobody
 * noticed until two services shared a table. Running everything as
 * `intafaced_ops` would throw that away, so we do not.
 *
 * svc-matching is absent on purpose: §5.1 gives it in-memory books and a file
 * journal, and no `DATABASE_URL` at all.
