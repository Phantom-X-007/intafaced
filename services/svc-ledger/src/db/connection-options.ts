/**
 * THE POSTING PATH MUST FAIL FAST, NOT HANG.
 *
 * Every post in this service takes `FOR UPDATE` on the singleton `chain_tip`
 * row, and the README states the consequence plainly: "posting throughput is
 * globally serial — one transaction at a time, platform-wide." That is a
 * deliberate design, and it has one operational edge. A single query that never
 * returns holds that lock, and **every** value movement in the OS — trading,
 * payments, escrow, staking, rewards — queues behind it with no bound and no
 * error. `transaction()` retries only on serialization failure and deadlock
 * (`40001` / `40P01`), so nothing recovers on its own.
 *
 * `statement_timeout` is what turns that from an indefinite platform-wide
 * outage into a failed transaction that rolls back and releases the lock.
 *
 * This service builds its own `postgres()` rather than using `createDb`, because
 * it needs a `search_path` the helper does not set. What it inherited from that
 * choice was every default the helper applies — including this one, which
 * `packages/db/src/connection.ts` documents in as many words: "Statement timeout
 * in ms. Money paths should fail fast, not hang."
 *
 * The values are the helper's, deliberately. A ledger post is a handful of
 * statements inside one transaction and comes nowhere near fifteen seconds; the
 * point of matching is that the most money-critical service in the OS should not
 * be the one running looser limits than the shared default it skipped.
