# Board Clear — Autonomous Run (GO prompt)

**Purpose:** One paste. World-class agentic engineering until the product board is Done/Cut.  
**Nitro is not in the tech loop.** No continue prompts. No vibe-code slop.  
**Version:** v3.3 · 2026-08-02 — parallel-session collision wall + tip freshness.

## Cold start / compact / continue read order

**0. FIRST:** `docs/BOARD-CLEAR-NEXT.md`  
**1.** `docs/BOARD-CLEAR-AFK-CONTRACT.md` · `docs/BOARD-CLEAR-PARALLEL-SESSIONS.md`  
**Never** TRACKER / WAVE-AUDIT / chat summary as live SoT.  
**Never** ask Nitro mid-run. Agent re-fetches tip + open PRs every cycle.

## Enhanced GO / CONTINUE prompt (copy entire fenced block)

```text
BOARD CLEAR — AFK AUTONOMY v3.3. Nitro away. Zero vibe-code. Zero continue prompts.
Pro-trader desk. Never invent mid/depth/rates/balances/candles.

SCOPE (BOARD-CLEAR-AFK-CONTRACT):
- AGENT-COMPLETE = agent-owned rows Done/Cut with proof (this session)
- BOARD-COMPLETE needs shehzad M1–M7 proof — NEVER steal implement
- Do not claim full board Done without his rows

PARALLEL (BOARD-CLEAR-PARALLEL-SESSIONS — binding):
- Every cycle: fetch tip + gh pr list + path-intersect EXACT NEXT with open PRs
- Dual-build same paths = defect → skip ship or babysit existing PR
- LIVE-LANES first claimer wins; other chats must not dual-claim
- Expect foreign traffic: order-route PRs, frontend/app density, shehzad, Denon
- After any main move: rewrite NEXT tip line + open-PR table before next ship

AFK / COMPACT (agent alone):
- Compact → open NEXT only → fetch → pr list → collision ritual → EXACT NEXT
- Rewrite NEXT before every pause. Never ask Nitro to re-open anything.

READ FIRST: docs/BOARD-CLEAR-NEXT.md
Then: AFK-CONTRACT · PARALLEL-SESSIONS
Then: git fetch && git log origin/main -1 --oneline && gh pr list --state open
Then: SCOREBOARD · AGENT-BACKLOG · LIVE-LANES · DECISION-AUTHORITY · CONSTITUTION · LOOPS · ENGINEERING-STANDARD

PHASES:
A) Agent residual path-clear ships (AGENT-BACKLOG) elite R→S→P→B→V→RV→M→U
B) Polish free paths (design bar, tests) — no M1–M7
C) After agent residual empty: HUMAN-BLOCKERS flush once

HUMAN M1–M7: babysit only. Parallel OPEN ≠ idle.

LOCKED B: protocol audit+deploy; trade HARD human/LIGHT agent; card=M1; Phase5 money=M6; #289 DONE

DECISIONS: agent default; X1–X5 queued until agent residual done
ANTI-SLOP: evidence; Class M failures; design bar; no invent; no fake Done; no apps/web

EVERY TURN: collision ritual; worktree from tip; evidence; thrift; update NEXT tip+exact ship
GH_TOKEN from ~/.grok/agent-auth/github_token

START / CONTINUE:
1) NEXT EXACT (path-clear) → ship
2) Drain agent residual → AGENT-COMPLETE
3) Flush HUMAN-BLOCKERS if needed
4) Report AGENT-COMPLETE + blockers OR BOARD-COMPLETE

No process theater. No Nitro in loop while session lives.
```

## Host rule (honest)

While **this agent session is alive**, Nitro does **nothing** after GO — including after compaction.  
If the **process/chat dies entirely**, nothing runs until a host restarts an agent with the same GO paste (optional scheduler). That is infrastructure, not “Nitro tech homework.”

## Auth

```bash
export GH_TOKEN="$(tr -d '\n\r ' < /Users/Nitro/.grok/agent-auth/github_token)"
```
