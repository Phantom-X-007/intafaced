# Spine branch disposition — 2026-08-15 (CURRENT)

**Tracker:** D26-P4-01. **Lane:** `denon-d26-p4-01-spine`.
**Replaces as current:** [`SPINE-BRANCH-DISPOSITION-2026-08-09.md`](SPINE-BRANCH-DISPOSITION-2026-08-09.md) (mechanisms still law; behind-counts and the DIRECTION-2026-07-31 §6 table are historical).
**This PR does not implement, rebase, force-push, or delete any spine.**

**Tip at write:** `1723273b` (`origin/main`, `test(svc-pay): card gateway stays Class X refuse, no invented issuer (#1995)`).
**Method:** `git fetch --prune` · `git ls-remote --heads origin` · `git rev-list --count` vs `origin/main` · `gh pr list --head` / `gh pr view` on Phantom-X-007/intafaced.

Leverage (Phase A IN): git + [`DIRECTION-2026-07-31.md`](../DIRECTION-2026-07-31.md) §6 + [`HANDOVER-NITRO-BRANCHES.md`](../HANDOVER-NITRO-BRANCHES.md) + the 2026-08-09 seal pass. No second SPA, no second book, no invented mids.

## Vocabulary (done-bar)

| Call | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| **merged** | Work is on tip via a named PR. The leftover `origin` ref (if any) is not a resume candidate. |
| **gone** | No `refs/heads` on origin. Merge PR named where one existed. |
| **abandon** | Ref still exists. Do not merge, rebase, or force-push. Delete when the ref-owner chooses. |
| **rewrite** | Genuine gap on tip. Recut on `origin/main`. Never resume the 2026-07-29 branch. |
| **resume** | Rebase / continue that branch. **Count this run: 0.** Nothing 1,792 commits behind is resumed. |
| **triage** | Still unread. **Count this run: 0.** |

**Shehzad chain spines are not resumed.** `feat/spine-dex-quotes`, `feat/spine-amm-reserves`, `feat/spine-academy-launch` (launchpad re-planed to Protocol) stay merged or abandon. Agents babysit only.

**Zero of the live refs should be merged or rebased.** Same headline as 2026-08-09; behind-count has grown ~570 commits since that pass (1,220 → 1,792).

## 1 · Ref set on origin (2026-08-15)

`git ls-remote --heads origin` matching `spine`: **17 refs** — 15 `feat/spine-*` plus `docs/spine-licence-position` and `fix/spine-token-factory-format`.

All fifteen `feat/spine-*` are still `theplugXE`, dated **2026-07-29**, **1,792–1,808 behind / 1–3 ahead**. None has an open or merged GitHub PR **from that head** (`gh pr list --state all --head feat/spine-<name>` → `[]` for every live feat ref).

`feat/spine-rebrand` still does not exist (confirmed `ls-remote`).

### Live `feat/spine-*` (15)

| Branch | Behind / ahead | Call | Proof |
| ------ | -------------- | ---- | ----- |
| `feat/spine-venue-fabric` | 1792 / 1 | **merged** | `#209` (`ee334a6f`) is an ancestor of `origin/main`. No PR from this head. |
| `feat/spine-dex-quotes` | 1792 / 1 | **merged** | `#101` (`843bde64`). `services/svc-dex/src/quote/quote-service.ts` on tip. **Shehzad plane — do not resume leftover.** |
| `feat/spine-market-seeder` | 1793 / 3 | **merged** | `#101`; seeder present as `vendor/upstream-exchange/seed-market-data.{js,mjs}` after `#771` rename. |
| `feat/spine-java-custody` | 1808 / 1 | **merged** | `#86` (`60031cfd`); path-moved `#771`. Endpoint-level seal is in the 2026-08-09 file §4. |
| `feat/spine-otc-desk` | 1792 / 1 | **abandon** | Branch never had a PR. `apps/web` deleted `#757`. Domain is tip `services/svc-trade/src/otc/**` (later OTC PRs, including `#1814` / `#1812`). Do not rebase. |
| `feat/spine-derivatives` | 1792 / 1 | **abandon** | Branch never had a PR. DIRECTION §6 said rewrite; that rewrite already happened on tip (`svc-trade` futures). Do not rebase the crash-WIP. |
| `feat/spine-screening-guard` | 1792 / 1 | **abandon** | Merging reopens `#432` (`33154d2a` ancestor). Mechanism: 2026-08-09 §3.1. DIRECTION §6 “RESUME” is stale. |
| `feat/spine-scope-issuance` | 1808 / 1 | **abandon** | Reverts landed auth (2026-08-09 §3.2). No PR from this head. |
| `feat/spine-java-rename` | 1792 / 2 | **abandon** | False-green / third vendor directory (2026-08-09 §3.3). |
| `feat/spine-bank-card` | 1792 / 2 | **abandon** | DIRECTION §3 still blocks sponsor-bank cards. Branch also has a silent migration collision (2026-08-09 §3.4). `assertProgramme` still absent under `svc-bank` — recut only when cards are unblocked, as a new tip PR, not this ref. |
| `feat/spine-academy-launch` | 1792 / 1 | **abandon** | **Shehzad / Protocol.** `services/svc-launch` still absent on tip. Do not resume. Prior art only (2026-08-09 §6.1). |
| `feat/spine-amm-reserves` | 1792 / 2 | **abandon** | **Shehzad / `svc-indexer`.** Tip drizzle is still only `0000_indexer_init`. Do not resume. Prior art only (2026-08-09 §6.2). Protocol `poolReserves` on tip is a chain read/refuse door, not this branch’s indexer projection. |
| `feat/spine-agent-fleet` | 1792 / 1 | **rewrite** | Spend-hold ledger plane still absent (`packages/ledger-client` has no `agentSpend` / spend-hold recipe). Recut on tip under a claimed lane. Never rebase this ref. |
| `feat/spine-dod-gate` | 1792 / 1 | **rewrite** | `tooling/e2e/` still absent. Branch CI would drop the gate catalogue if its side won (2026-08-09 §3.6). Carry the harness onto tip; never take the branch workflow. |
| `feat/spine-market-stability` | 1792 / 2 | **rewrite** | `CoinExchangeRate.java` is still **268** lines on tip (branch’s honesty rewrite never landed). Compose `restart: unless-stopped` **has** landed on tip `docker-compose.yml` — do not take the branch compose (2026-08-09 §3.5 bindings). Recut Java rate-source honesty on tip only. |

### Other live spine-named refs (2)

| Branch | Behind / ahead | Call | Proof |
| ------ | -------------- | ---- | ----- |
| `docs/spine-licence-position` | 1808 / 1 | **merged** | `#86` (`60031cfd`). No PR from this head. Pass 1 + 2026-08-09 §2. |
| `fix/spine-token-factory-format` | 1677 / 6 | **merged** | `#217` (`0f5c43b3`) + `#221` (`2f6ab476`). Both ancestors of `origin/main`. |

### Gone (historical names; `ls-remote` empty)

| Name | Call | Merge PR (head was this branch) |
| ---- | ---- | ------------------------------- |
| `feat/spine-token-factory` | **gone** | [\#217](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/pull/217) merged 2026-07-30 |
| `feat/spine-indexer-readmodels` | **gone** | [\#218](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/pull/218) merged 2026-07-30 |
| `feat/spine-trading-hours` | **gone** | [\#102](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/pull/102) merged 2026-07-29 |
| `feat/spine-wallet-perimeter` | **gone** | [\#189](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/pull/189) merged 2026-07-30 |
| `feat/spine-venue-hours` | **gone** | [\#194](https://github.com/Phantom-X-007/intafaced/pull/194) merged 2026-07-30 |
| `feat/spine-rebrand` | **gone** | Never existed as a spine ref (2026-08-09 §1). |

## 3 · Counts (this re-derive)

| Call | Count | Notes |
| ---- | ----: | ----- |
| **merged** (live refs, work on tip) | **6** | 4 `feat/spine-*` + licence-position + token-factory-format |
| **abandon** | **8** | includes 2 Shehzad (`academy-launch`, `amm-reserves`) + 2 superseded crash-WIPs (`otc-desk`, `derivatives`) |
| **rewrite** (greenfield on tip) | **3** | `agent-fleet`, `dod-gate`, `market-stability` — not this PR |
| **resume** | **0** | |
| **triage** | **0** | |
| **gone** | **6** | 5 merged-and-deleted + 1 never-existed |
| Live `feat/spine-*` still on origin | **15** | all 2026-07-29 |

DIRECTION-2026-07-31 §6 said RESUME on `market-seeder`, `java-custody`, `screening-guard`. Those three calls are **wrong on this tip**: first two are merged; screening-guard is abandon.

## 4 · What not to do

1. Do not merge or rebase any remaining `feat/spine-*`.
2. Do not resume Shehzad chain spines (`dex-quotes` leftover, `amm-reserves`, `academy-launch`).
3. Delete SEAL-CLOSED leftover refs only as a separate owner action (2026-08-09 §8). This file does not delete them.
4. Rewrite rows are findings, not claims. Implementers claim LIVE-LANES and path-intersect open PRs first.

Dangerous-merge mechanisms (sanctions boot-guard, forever-valid token, false-green rename, silent migration, compose bind-all, CI gate drop, academy deletion) are unchanged: [`SPINE-BRANCH-DISPOSITION-2026-08-09.md`](SPINE-BRANCH-DISPOSITION-2026-08-09.md) §3.
