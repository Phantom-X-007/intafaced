/**
 * TYPE-CHECK THE TESTS — the only code in this repo that had no type gate.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS ACTUALLY TRUE BEFORE THIS FILE ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Thirty-one of the thirty-two workspace tsconfigs carried this line:
 *
 *     "exclude": ["src/**\/*.test.ts", "dist", "node_modules"]
 *
 * and every `typecheck` script was `tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit`. So `tsc` was
 * told, in every package but one, not to look at a single test file. Vitest does
 * not close the gap: esbuild strips types without checking them. Between the two
 * there was no step anywhere — local or CI — that ever type-checked a test.
 *
 * The proof that this was not theoretical is one import block in
 * `packages/contracts/src/ops-analytics.test.ts`, which imported
 * `countMetricsUsingSource` twice, thirteen lines apart:
 *
 *     ops-analytics.test.ts(8,3):  error TS2300: Duplicate identifier …
 *     ops-analytics.test.ts(21,3): error TS2300: Duplicate identifier …
 *
 * `pnpm --filter @intafaced/contracts typecheck` exited 0 with that on disk. It
 * reached main because nothing could see it. `svc-academy`'s ladder suite had
 * six more of the same shape.
 *
 * ── WHY TESTS ARE THE WORST PLACE TO HAVE NO TYPE GATE ──────────────────────
 *
 * A test file is where a fixture encodes an assumption about a production type.
 * When the type moves and the fixture does not, the fixture is still a valid
 * JavaScript object, vitest still runs it, and the assertion still passes — it
 * just no longer exercises the thing it names. That is worse than a failing
 * test: it is a green tick over a proof that has quietly stopped applying. Most
 * of the pinned findings below are exactly that — `Property 'service' is missing
 * in type … but required in type 'Context'` is a `Context` fixture that drifted
 * away from `Context`.
 *
 * ── WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A CLEAN SWEEP ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Switching the check on revealed 84 diagnostics across 16 packages. Fourteen of
 * them were the duplicate-identifier class named above, which is fixed in the
 * same change as this file because deleting a symbol imported twice cannot alter
 * behaviour. The remaining 70 are real type drift in fifteen packages —
 * including two with other agents live in them — and each needs a judgement
 * about whether the fixture or the production type is the wrong one. Bundling 70
 * such judgements into the change that installs the mechanism would produce a
 * diff nobody can review, and weakening the config to make it green would
 * install a gate that gates nothing, which is the defect being fixed.
 *
 * So: the mechanism lands enforcing, with today's failures pinned. This is the
 * pattern the repo already uses in `fabricated-money-scan` (12 frozen),
 * `vendor-java-money-scan` (55) and `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan` (57). A NEW error
 * fails the build. A pinned one that gets FIXED also fails the build, telling
 * you to delete its row — so the list can only shrink, and it cannot rot into
 * blanket cover.
 *
 * ── WHY PINS CARRY NO LINE NUMBER, AND DO CARRY A COUNT ─────────────────────
 *
 * A pin keyed by line number breaks when someone adds an import above it, and a
 * gate that goes red for an unrelated edit gets switched off. So a pin is
 * `file | code | message`, which survives movement within a file.
 *
 * Dropping the line number would let a second identical error hide behind the
 * first, so each pin carries HOW MANY times it appears — the same reason
 * `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan` freezes its constants by text *and* by count. Five
 * `Expected 2-3 arguments, but got 1` used to pin five call sites in
 * `router.mount.test.ts`; that pin was deleted when those sites passed the
 * instruments stub. A pin is `file | code | message` plus HOW MANY times it
 * appears — the same reason `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan` freezes its constants by
 * text *and* by count.
 *
 * Absolute paths inside a message (TS6059 and TS7016 quote them) are rewritten
 * to `<repo>` so a pin means the same thing on a laptop and on a CI runner.
 *
 * ── HOW IT IS WIRED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not as a doctrine gate — this needs `^build` for cross-package types, which is
 * exactly what the turbo `typecheck` task already guarantees. Every package's
 * script is now:
 *
 *     tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit && node ../../tooling/ci/test-typecheck.mjs
 *
 * so `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm verify` and CI all run it, in parallel, cached, with
 * the dependency graph already resolved. `tooling/ci/gates.mjs` lists it under
 * NOT_GATES with this reason.
 *
 * A package with NO `tsconfig.test.json` is not skipped: it must instead prove
 * that its own `tsconfig.json` does not exclude tests (which is how `apps/admin`
 * has always covered its four suites). Deleting a `tsconfig.test.json` to make
 * this quiet therefore fails too.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tooling/ci/test-typecheck.mjs           check the package in cwd
 *   node tooling/ci/test-typecheck.mjs --all     check every workspace package
 *   node tooling/ci/test-typecheck.mjs --report  print findings, never exit 1
