/**
 * THE ORDER BOOK (§5.1).
 *
 * "In-memory books per market: price-time priority, limit/market/stop,
 *  post-only, IOC/FOK … Deterministic, event-sourced, replayable."
 *
 * This file is pure. No I/O, no async, no clock, no randomness, and nothing
 * that iterates an unordered collection in a way that reaches the output. That
 * is not stylistic: §5.4 requires that replaying the journal twice produces
 * byte-identical state, and every one of those would break it.
 *
 * Specifically forbidden in here, forever:
 *   - `Date.now()` / `new Date()` — time enters via the journal, never the book
 *   - `Math.random()` / `crypto.randomUUID()` — ids come from the caller
 *   - a JS `number` holding a price or a quantity — prices and quantities are
 *     `Amount`, the scaled bigint from `@intafaced/ledger-client`
 *
 * The only `number` in the whole file is `sequence`, a monotonic counter.
