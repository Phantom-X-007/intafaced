# Board Clear — Preflight Audit (methodology + blockers)

**Date:** 2026-08-01  
**Tip audited:** `origin/main` @ `346d3c7` (+ fixes in this PR)  
**Purpose:** Hunt anything that would stop or compromise “GO once → finish board.”  
**Verdict after fixes in same PR:** see §9.

## 2. Critical findings (would block or re-compromise goal)

### C1 — Ownership law forbids shipping trade mountains product

**Where:** `NITRO-OWNERSHIP` §4.6: product law for futures/OTC/copy/algo/MM is Denon-only.  
**Conflict:** Board Clear B2 = all trade mountains in scope with Done bars.  
**Risk:** Cold agent obeys ownership, refuses to ship, reverts to residual theater.  
**Fix:** Precedence: **Board Clear constitution wins for campaign Done bars** as Nitro locked 2026-08-01; still never invent mid/rates/depth; thin slice or §13 OK; force-push spine still banned.

### C2 — LIVE-LANES is residual-era and caps parallel

**Where:** LIVE-LANES residual-coord, ≤3 lanes, stale claims, order-route separate.  
**Risk:** Agents claim wrong program, refuse fan-out, double-build or idle.  
**Fix:** LIVE-LANES rewritten for Board Clear programs P-UI…P-P5; parallel = ownership map not ≤3.

### C3 — Product UI path wrong in execution plan

**Where:** Plan said `apps/web`; reality = **vendor exchange shell :8090** (`vendor/.../05_Web_Front`).  
**Risk:** Agents polish dead spike; web.terminal never Done.  
**Fix:** Constitution + plan + P-UI paths = vendor shell + frontend SoT.

### C4 — #289 not mergeable

**Where:** PR #289 `CONFLICTING`, behind main by ~12, ahead 7. CI was green on old tip.  
**Risk:** “Claimed” but orphan forever if GO agent ignores rebase.  
**Fix:** A-OR-1 mandatory first-class: rebase/fix/merge or split absorb same week; scoreboard tracks.

### C5 — Session prompt still says ≤3 lanes + residual ship gate

**Where:** NITRO-SESSION-PROMPT LIVE-LANES ≤3; commits unless go-all-out.  
**Risk:** Soft undo of Board Clear parallel + autonomy.  
**Fix:** Explicit Board Clear supersession block in session prompt + START-HERE.

### C6 — Chat death has no auto-wake

**Where:** Process assumes human re-pastes GO after compact/session end.  
**Risk:** Campaign freezes if Nitro never re-opens chat.  
**Mitigation (honest):** (a) NEXT+docs resume on any new session with same paste; (b) optional scheduled re-fire documented; (c) **not** full unattended OS process without a host session.  
**Not a doc lie:** Green light = process complete; **host must run an agent session** (or re-open after death with same paste).

| H9  | Graphify re-index on docs corpus                            | Agent duty if corpus live                        |
| H10 | OHLCV/candles / mark index need real jobs                   | Ships in plan; no invent                         |

## 6. What we are NOT compromising

- Ledger-only money
- No invent mid/depth/rates/candles
- No Class X prod go-live as agent-done
- No force-push Denon spine
- Worktrees / PR / CI
- Honest Cut over fake Done

---

## 7. Pre-GO physical checklist

- [x] Board Clear docs on main (after this PR)
- [x] Precedence over residual + ownership product-law ban for campaign
- [x] LIVE-LANES Board Clear
- [x] UI = vendor :8090
- [x] #289 dirty named as first-class work
- [x] GO paste includes read order + loops
- [ ] **Human:** open agent session and paste GO (required host)
- [ ] **Human if chat dies:** paste same GO again

## 8. Fixes shipped in preflight PR

1. Ownership precedence + Board Clear supersession
2. LIVE-LANES Board Clear rewrite
3. Constitution/plan UI path + #289 note
4. Session prompt + START-HERE conflict kill
5. GO-READINESS final + this audit
6. NEXT updated for post-audit GO

---

## 9. Final green-light verdict

**GREEN LIGHT: YES — say GO.**

Process, Done bars, loops, anti-compromise fixes, and conflict resolution are sufficient for a competent orchestrator to run until scoreboard COMPLETE under constitution **without Nitro decisions**.

**You must:** paste GO in a live agent session (and re-paste if the session dies).  
**You must not:** re-open B1–B5, switch back to residual-only prompts, or expect product Done without the loop running.

**Not guaranteed:** zero agent mistakes, infinite free CI, external audit firm signature, prod PSP keys. Those are covered by self-audit, thrift, audit package, sandbox Done.
