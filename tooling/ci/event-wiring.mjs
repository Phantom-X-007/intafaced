/**
 * EVENT WIRING — a declared subject has a publisher and a subscriber, or a reason.
 *
 * ── The three failures this exists for ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three separate audits hit the event bus from three directions and each found
 * the same shape. Not one of them was found on purpose:
 *
 *   1. `bankMarginCalled` was a fully-built event. Its schema was careful, its
 *      consumer in svc-notify complete — severity `critical`, a business key of
 *      `<loanId>:<sequence>`, the lot. NOTHING PUBLISHED IT. svc-bank depended
 *      on neither `@intafaced/events` nor `nats`, and no service claimed the
 *      `bank` stream, so `INTAFACED_BANK` had never existed and svc-notify
 *      logged a consumer it could not attach on every boot since it shipped.
 *      CLOSED: svc-bank owns the stream and publishes the call
 *      (services/svc-bank/src/loans/margin-call-publisher.ts). Kept in this
 *      header because the shape is what the gate is for, not the instance —
 *      and because it was found by accident, three months after it shipped.
 *
 *   2. `xpEarned` was published by svc-p2p AND svc-trade, and read by nobody.
 *      Both producers said in their own comments that svc-identity is the way
 *      into `rank_state`; svc-identity subscribed to two blueprint subjects and
 *      nothing else. The tracker called `p2p.reputation` done on the strength of
 *      reputation "feeding the same XP graph". It did not reach the graph, so
 *      every rank shown to a P2P or trading user was wrong by what they earned.
 *      CLOSED: `subscribeXpEvents` in services/svc-identity/src/events.ts.
 *
 *   3. `orderFilled` "dropped account ids". The cause was a stale build: zod
 *      silently strips unknown keys, so a consumer compiled against an older
 *      schema deletes fields with no error anywhere. That one is fixed in
 *      `packages/events/src/bus.ts` — the bus now refuses rather than strips —
 *      and it is named here because it is the same disease: the bus could not
 *      tell anyone that two sides of a subject disagreed.
 *
 * The common shape: THE BUS COULD NOT REPORT SILENCE. An event with no producer,
 * no consumer, or a schema mismatch looked exactly like an event that was fine.
 * Each cost an engineer real time and each was found by accident.
 *
 * ── What this gate forbids ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Silence. Not orphans — orphans are frequently legitimate, and `ledgerTxPosted`
 * is one: a durable, replayable record ahead of its first reader, which nothing
 * derives state from and nothing claims to. What is forbidden is an orphan
 * NOBODY WROTE DOWN. Every unwired end is either an entry in `WIRING_SOCKETS`
 * (packages/events/src/catalog.ts) carrying a reason a human typed AND a class,
 * or this exits 1.
 *
 * Same principle as `workspace-sync` check 7, and the same escape hatch shape as
 * its `# no-deploy:` comment: the deliberate case must be declared, in a file a
 * reviewer reads, in prose.
 *
 * DELETING AN EVENT IS NEVER HOW YOU MAKE THIS PASS. An orphan is a finding.
 *
 * ── Why it will not cry wolf ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A gate that fires on prose gets switched off, and then the real failure it was
 * written for goes through it unnoticed. `workspace-sync` check 6 went red on
 * `main` for everyone because it matched a COMMENT. So:
 *
 *   · comments are blanked before anything is matched — character-for-character,
 *     newlines kept, so every line number reported is the real one;
 *   · `*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` are not wiring. A subject that only a test
 *     publishes has no publisher;
 *   · NO regex here is built from a template literal. `\s` inside one is the
 *     letter s, which has silently broken three gates in this repo in three
 *     days (see workspace-sync checks 3b and 7). The two regexes that must be
 *     assembled are composed from `RegExp.source` of regex literals, so the
 *     escaping is written once, by the engine, in a context that cannot eat a
 *     backslash. A mutation that reintroduced the trap here SURVIVED — the
 *     pattern still matched by luck — which is why the dynamic regex it lived
 *     in was removed outright rather than corrected;
 *   · anything it cannot resolve is reported as unresolvable rather than guessed
 *     at in either direction. A gate that quietly assumes "wired" hides the bug
 *     it exists to find; one that quietly assumes "orphan" is the wolf.
 *
 * ── Sockets are not all the same thing (ADR D-S-13, Accepted 2026-08-04) ────
 *
 * This gate used to count all eighteen sockets identically, and that one number
 * covered both "the stream is a durable record ahead of its first reader" and
 * "a borrower is never told their loan is being margin-called". A written reason
 * proves somebody thought about it. It does not prove the answer was yes.
 *
 * So every socket now carries a CLASS, and the class decides whether it counts:
 *
 *   A — record ahead of its reader. Nothing depends on the consumer existing,
 *       and nothing claims it does. A true socket, legitimate indefinitely.
 *   B — a promise with no delivery. A user or an operator already believes
 *       something the missing consumer would have to deliver. NOT a socket; a
 *       defect wearing a socket's clothes. RATCHETED, not unconditionally red:
 *       the known ones are pinned by hand in `CLASS_B_AWAITING_A_DECISION`
 *       with a named decider, and a NEW one fails. See the long note there for
 *       why an unconditional red was the wrong reading of the ADR. Every Class
 *       B prints in full on every run either way.
 *   C — owned and unbuilt, AND the gap is disclosed wherever a user could
 *       otherwise be misled. A socket with a name on it.
 *
 * The test is not "is there a consumer". It is: does anyone — user or operator —
 * currently hold a belief the missing wiring would have to deliver?
 *
 * An entry that declares no class is REJECTED. A socket declaration is a claim
 * that nothing is broken, and an unclassified one is that claim made without
 * anyone having been asked to check it.
 *
 * ── WIRED MEANS MOUNTED, NOT MERELY DEFINED ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The fourth instance of this gate's own defect class, and it went through the
 * gate built to catch it.
 *
 * `crewMemberCreated` was a pinned Class B socket: the catalog said in as many
 * words that "svc-academy routes the lobby, svc-agents opens the crew channel"
 * and NEITHER EXISTS. Commit e1b95844 added a `crew-events.ts` to each service,
 * each exporting a `subscribeCrewMemberCreated` that calls `bus.subscribe`, and
 * DELETED the socket entry. The scan below saw two `.subscribe('crewMemberCreated')`
 * calls and agreed: wired, no socket needed, Class B count zero, green.
 *
 * Neither subscriber was ever mounted. `svc-academy/src/index.ts` does not
 * import the file — and says in its own header that the service has NO BUS
 * CONNECTION AT ALL. `svc-agents/src/index.ts` connects to NATS and never calls
 * `subscribeCrewMemberCreated`. Nothing but the two unit tests ever referenced
 * either function. The event ended up neither wired nor recorded: invisible to
 * the check, with the honest entry that preceded it deleted. Strictly worse than
 * the socket it replaced, and exactly what ADR D-S-13 calls "a check that reports
 * on something real, in a shape that gets read as evidence for something it never
 * examined."
 *
 * A TEXTUAL SCAN CANNOT TELL A DEFINED HANDLER FROM A RUNNING ONE. Existence is
 * not wiring. So a call only counts when the file it lives in is REACHABLE, and
 * the service that reaches it actually has a bus:
 *
 *   · entrypoints are derived from each service's own `package.json` (`main`, or
 *     the `node dist/….js` in `scripts.start`), mapped `dist/*.js` → `src/*.ts` —
 *     not a hardcoded `index.ts`, so a service that moves its entry moves this
 *     with it instead of quietly falling out of the graph;
 *   · the import graph is walked transitively from those entrypoints. `import
 *     type` is NOT a mount: a type-only edge is erased at compile time and
 *     mounts no handler;
 *   · a service "has a bus" when something in ITS reachable set constructs one.
 *     Keyed on the `EventBus` name suffix rather than on `JetStreamEventBus`
 *     exactly, for the same reason the relay rule keys on the type rather than
 *     on a parameter spelled `bus`: the suffix survives a rename.
 *
 * Both halves are load-bearing and svc-academy fails both — its file is not
 * imported, AND its service builds no bus, so mounting the import alone would
 * still not make the handler run. svc-agents fails only the first, which is why
 * the first alone is not enough to describe what is broken.
 *
 * A site that does not count is NOT silently dropped — silence is this gate's
 * whole enemy. Every one prints under DEFINED BUT NEVER MOUNTED, with which of
 * the two conditions it failed. It does not itself exit 1: the consequence is
 * that the event stops being counted as wired, which pushes it back to needing a
 * WIRING_SOCKETS entry — and THAT is what fails, in the place the ADR wants the
 * argument to happen.
 *
 * ── Fail closed on an empty walk ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This repo has a named recurring defect: checks that report on nothing and get
 * read as evidence. Four gates were landed to close it. So if the catalog parses
 * to zero events, or the source scan walks zero files, or the socket list parses
 * to zero entries while there is clearly text in it, or NO SERVICE ENTRYPOINT
 * RESOLVES and the reachability walk therefore mounts nothing, this exits 1
 * rather than
 * printing ✓ over a scan it never performed — the same fail-closed derivation
 * `custody-scan.mjs` uses when the module registry yields no Protocol Plane
 * service. A gate that reports green over a file it never opened is worse than
 * no gate.
 *
 * Exit 0 = every declared subject is wired at both ends or recorded as a
 * classified socket, and every Class B is one a human already pinned by name.

 * ── CLASS B IS A DEFECT, AND THE DEFECT IS RATCHETED ───────────────────────

 * about Class B, about what an unconditional red does to a repo.
 *
 * The ADR itself puts `crewMemberCreated`'s consumers on the owner ("services
 * with their own scope questions"). So no agent can ever make that entry go
 * away, and an unconditional red would be permanent, would block every
 * unrelated merge in a repo landing several PRs an hour, and would end with
 * somebody deleting the gate — taking the whole classification with it. A gate
 * that is red on every run is a gate whose red means nothing; `gates.mjs` says
 * so itself about `advisory`.
 *
 * The repo has already answered this three times — `fabricated-money-scan`
 * froze 12 findings, `vendor-java-money-scan` 63, `wallet-rpc-mainnet-scan` 38.
 * None fails on the pre-existing set. Each PINS it and fails on any deviation.
 * Same answer here.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TRADES AWAY IS THE EXIT CODE AND NOTHING ELSE. Every Class B
 * finding is printed in full on every run, in the gate's normal output, with
 * the same text the failing version used. The debt is on the summary line too,
 * because `gates.mjs` shows only the last non-empty line and a green tick over
 * an unnamed defect is how a frozen queue becomes a forgotten one.
 *
 * ── The list is HAND-WRITTEN, and derived from nothing ─────────────────────
 *
 * A pinned list computed from the catalog would agree with whatever the catalog
 * says, which is not a check. Every row is typed by a human, names WHO must
 * decide, and names WHAT would clear it — so the list reads as a decision queue
 * rather than a suppression list, and an entry nobody can name an owner for
 * cannot be added to it.
 *
 * `reasonFingerprint` pins `sha256(reason)` to 12 hex. This is the row that
 * closes the hole the ADR names by name: softening a reason until the entry
 * classifies better. Rewrite the reason and the fingerprint goes stale and the
 * gate goes red, whatever the class still says. Line numbers are deliberately
 * absent — they drift on every edit above them, and a baseline that goes stale
 * for an unrelated reason is a baseline someone deletes.
 *
 * NOTHING IS EVER ADDED HERE TO MAKE A BUILD GREEN. A new Class B is a defect

 * stream does not exist yet is reported instead of thrown. A literal-only scan
 * reads all nine of its consumers as absent and declares nine false orphans —
 * including `kycApproved` and `stakeCreated`, which are wired and working.
 *
 * That is exactly the wolf this gate must not cry, so one level of indirection
 * is resolved: a named function in a bus-aware file that calls `.subscribe(x)`
 * on a non-literal becomes a subscribe-relay, and a call to it carrying a
 * catalog event literal counts as a subscriber. Module-local only — a relay is
 * matched against calls in its own file, so an unrelated same-named helper in
 * another package cannot be mistaken for one.
 *
 * `publish` and `subscribe` are ORDINARY WORDS, and this repo uses them for
 * things that are not the bus: svc-ws has a `hub.publish(update)` that fans a
 * private order to sockets, and apps/web has stores with `.subscribe(setState)`.
 * An early draft treated every one of those as a bus call, which made
 * `subscribePrivateOrders()` look like a relay publishing some undetermined
 * subject — a fabricated finding against a file that is entirely correct.
 *
 * The fix is to define a relay precisely rather than to guess from names. A
 * relay FORWARDS ITS OWN PARAMETER TO A BUS, so all four of these must hold:
 *
 *   · the file imports the bus;
 *   · the first argument is a bare identifier, not a literal or an object —
 *     `hub.publish({ … })` is excluded by its shape, with no name-matching;
 *   · that identifier is a PARAMETER of the enclosing named function, which is
 *     what makes it forwarded rather than captured;
 *   · that function takes an `EventBus`.
 *
 * The last one is load-bearing and was learned the hard way. Without it, a
 * helper like `fanOut(hub, update) { hub.publish(update) }` — a socket fan-out
 * in svc-ws, nothing to do with NATS — registers as a publish-relay for an
 * undetermined subject and the gate fails on a correct file. A mutation test
 * caught that; reading the code had not.
 *
 * And it is keyed on the TYPE rather than on the receiver being spelled `bus`.
 * A name rule also passes today and breaks the day somebody renames the
 * parameter to `eventPipe` — breaking by reporting nine wired consumers as
 * orphans, which is the one failure mode this gate must never have. The type
 * survives the rename; the name does not.
