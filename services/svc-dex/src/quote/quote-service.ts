/**
 * THE QUOTE PATH — fetch, age-check, sweep, route, or REFUSE.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE ONE RULE
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * **There is no code path in this file that returns a price it did not source.**
 *
 * No cache, no last-known value, no fallback venue, no "best effort" answer with
 * a warning attached. Every exit is either a route built from books read within
 * `QUOTE_MAX_AGE_MS`, or a `QuoteRefusedError` carrying a machine-readable code
 * and the reason each venue dropped out.
 *
 * That asymmetry is the product decision, not a style choice. A refusal costs a
 * user a retry. A stale or invented price costs them a trade, and they will not
 * know it happened until the fill comes back at a number that was never on any
 * venue. An error is recoverable; a bad fill is not.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * "BEST OF N" MUST NOT MEAN "THE ONLY ONE THAT ANSWERED"
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A cross-venue router degrades quietly by nature: three venues configured, two
 * time out, and the survivor's price is presented as the best of three. It is
 * not — it is the only one, and the user has no way to tell.
 *
 * So the response states it. `venuesConfigured` is how many were asked,
 * `venues` is who priced, `unavailable` is who did not and why, `degraded` is
 * true whenever those two disagree, and `singleVenue` is true when exactly one
 * survived out of more than one. That ranking honesty is not a certified
 * best-execution claim — `bestEx.claimed` stays false until owner law is set.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHAT IS REUSED, AND WHY THAT SPLIT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * · `sweepCost` — `@intafaced/venue-adapter`. Walking a book for a quantity is
 *   solved and tested there. A second implementation of the same walk is a
 *   second thing to be wrong.
 * · `route` / `effectivePrice` — this service's `router-quote.ts`. It is the
 *   only router in the repo that models `settlementCost`, and on the Protocol
 *   Plane gas is not a rounding error: it is what makes a small order prefer a
 *   book and a large one still prefer a pool.
 *
 * The division is clean: **venue-adapter gets liquidity, svc-dex decides.** And
 * the decision is on effective price alone — every venue arrives as the same
 * `LiquiditySource`, so nothing here can favour our own book.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * STALENESS
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `QUOTE_MAX_AGE_MS` (owner-published; never git-default 2000) is enforced HERE, once, against
 * `TimestampedBook.observedAt` — the moment this process finished reading the
 * venue.
 *
 * Measuring at assembly rather than at fetch is the point. A venue that answers
 * in 20ms and a venue that answers in 1900ms produce books of very different
 * ages by the time they are compared, and routing the second against the first
 * as though they were simultaneous is how a router picks a venue whose price has
 * already moved. Both are aged against one clock reading taken after every fetch
 * has landed.
 *
 * A book dated in the FUTURE is refused too. It is tempting to treat a negative
 * age as "very fresh"; it is a broken clock somewhere, and a broken clock is the
 * one condition under which the ceiling silently stops working.
