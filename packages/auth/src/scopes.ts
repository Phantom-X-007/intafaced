/**
 * THE SCOPES A NORMAL INTERACTIVE SESSION CARRIES.
 *
 * This list is the platform's answer to "what may a logged-in account do", and
 * it lives here rather than inside svc-identity so the services enforcing the
 * scopes and the service issuing them read from one file.
 *
 * ── The rule, stated once ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A scope answers "is this account entitled to this class of action, at all".
 * The JURISDICTION_MATRIX answers "may this caller do it here, today, at this
 * verification tier". Different questions, different answers, checked at
 * different times:
 *
 *   - A scope is minted into a token that outlives the request that made it.
 *     Making issuance region-dependent would bind a token to the region it was
 *     issued in, and a user who travelled would lose access until it rotated.
 *   - The matrix is evaluated per request against `ctx.region` — resolved by the
 *     edge, never by the caller — and `principal.tier`. Both can change between
 *     a token being issued and being used.
 *
 * So: issue the scope, and let the matrix rule on tier and region.
 *
 * The alternative — withholding `bank:write` until a user is verified — sounds
 * safer and is worse. It is not a real constraint, because every bank procedure
 * is matrix-gated at tier `full` whatever scopes the caller holds. What it does
 * change is the refusal: "you lack a scope" instead of "you need verification
 * tier full", which is a dead end the UI cannot turn into an action.
 *
 * ── What that rule does NOT license ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything absent from this list is absent for a stated reason, in
 * WITHHELD_FROM_SESSION below. The compiler enforces that the two together
 * cover SCOPES exactly, so a new scope cannot reach a token — or fail to —
 * without someone deciding, in writing, who gets it.
