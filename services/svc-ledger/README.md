# svc-ledger

**THE BALANCE (§4.2).** The single wallet graph for the entire OS. Every value movement anywhere in INTAFACED is a double-entry transaction here.

**What this service is not:** it does not decide whether a movement is _allowed_. That is the calling module's job — svc-trade decides an order may be placed, svc-p2p decides an escrow may release. This service decides only whether a transaction is _legal_: balanced, funded, and idempotent. It will refuse an illegal one from any caller, including one of ours.

## API

Internal tRPC. Note there is no user-facing write path, and `packages/auth` has no `ledger:write` scope at all — a user moves value by asking a module to act, never by calling the ledger.

| Procedure   | Scope               | Input                                       | Output                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `health`    | —                   | —                                           | `{ ok, service, postingEnabled }`                                                                                             |
| `post`      | service credentials | `PostRequest` (decimal-string amounts)      | `{ txId, hash, postedAt }`                                                                                                    |
| `balance`   | `ledger:read`       | `AccountRef`                                | `{ accountId, assetId, kind, purpose, amount }`                                                                               |
| `balances`  | `ledger:read`       | `{ ownerType, ownerId }`                    | `{ accountId, assetId, kind, purpose, amount }[]` — own pots only; `purpose` is identity (P0-3), empty string when unpurposed |
| `history`   | service credentials | `{ account, from, to }` — ISO, `[from, to)` | `{ txId, module, reason, direction, amount, postedAt }[]`                                                                     |
| `reconcile` | `admin:treasury`    | —                                           | `{ ok, accountsChecked, chainLength, unbalancedAssets, chainBrokenAt? }`                                                      |
| `freeze`    | `admin:treasury`    | `{ reason, confirmOperatorId }`             | `{ postingEnabled, frozenReason, frozenBy, confirmOperatorId }`                                                               |
| `unfreeze`  | `admin:treasury`    | `{ confirmOperatorId }`                     | `{ postingEnabled, frozenReason, frozenBy, confirmOperatorId }`                                                               |

HTTP: `GET /health` (liveness) · `GET /ready` — returns **503 when frozen**, so a frozen ledger leaves the load balancer rotation instead of refusing posts one by one.

### Operator HTTP (`admin:treasury` + MFA on every route)

tRPC procedures above are exported for their type; **nothing mounts the tRPC plugin**. Operator control reaches the process through raw Fastify routes:

| Method | Path                  | Effect                                                                      |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/operator/freeze`    | Durable `posting_freeze` row                                                |
| `POST` | `/operator/freeze`    | Halt posting (`reason` ≥ 12 chars + distinct `confirmOperatorId`)           |
| `POST` | `/operator/unfreeze`  | Resume posting (distinct `confirmOperatorId`)                               |
| `POST` | `/operator/reconcile` | Full three-check run (balances · chain · totalsByAsset); freezes on failure |

Operator freeze/unfreeze is dual-control: the signed treasury principal plus a distinct `confirmOperatorId`. Missing or same-as-operator confirm refuses (`missing_operator`) — the ledger does not invent a second caller. Reconciliation and boot `LEDGER_POSTING_ENABLED=false` still freeze through `LedgerService` without a confirmer (not operator doors).

`POST /operator/reconcile` is the on-demand path for apps/admin. A broken chain reports `chainLength` as how far verification got and names `chainBrokenAt` — never collapses a break to zero (that would look like an empty healthy book). Edge/admin must proxy this route; until they do, the scheduled job and this path are the live answers.

### `history` — a read, and the two ways it refuses

The projection source for svc-bank's spend view (§8.1). That service keeps no `spent_this_month` counter — a second source of truth for money in everything but name — so it folds this window on demand instead. It is a READ: it takes no chain-tip lock, touches no balance, and has no path into `post()`.

**Service credentials, not `ledger:read`.** The caller is a service, and it forwards no user token: svc-bank has already decided, with the user's token, which spaces that user may see. The input is a bare `AccountRef`, which can name `house` and `treasury` accounts — `rail:*`, `fees:*`, `mint` — and unlike `balances` there is nothing in it to compare a principal against, so `ledger:read` would turn every holder of a read scope into someone who can enumerate the platform's own movements transaction by transaction. Which human may see a movement stays svc-bank's question, exactly as whether a movement is _allowed_ stays the calling module's.

**Bounded at 10 000 entries per window, and it refuses rather than truncating.** An unbounded read of the service that owns every balance in the OS is one request away from exhausting its heap, so there is a cap. Returning the first 10 000 would produce an array indistinguishable from a complete one — svc-bank would sum it and call the total "your spending", short by whatever fell off the end with nothing saying so. So over the cap the read refuses with `ledger.history_range_too_large`, naming the cap and the window; the remedy is a narrower window, and it works. The query asks for `cap + 1` rows: one row past the cap is enough to know the answer would have been clipped, and memory stays bounded either way.

An **inverted** window (`to` before `from`) refuses too — `ledger.history_range_invalid`. It matches no row, so an empty array would be a plausible-looking answer to a question nobody meant to ask. A **zero-width** window (`from == to`) is legal and empty: half-open `[t, t)` genuinely contains nothing. An account that has never been posted to answers `[]`, and reading it does not create it.

> **§13 socket — paged history.** Nothing browses this yet, and a `limit` without a cursor is silent truncation with a parameter in front of it. When a paged history is needed, add `after: <entry id>` and page on `(posted_at, e.id)` — the order this already returns, and the one `ledger_entries_account_idx` already supports.

## Events

**Publishes**

| Subject                                  | When                          | Payload                                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `intafaced.ledger.tx.posted`             | after every commit            | tx id, module, reason, hash chain link, all entries |
| `intafaced.ledger.reconciliation.failed` | drift or chain break detected | account, cached vs replayed balance, difference     |
| `intafaced.ledger.freeze.updated`        | posting frozen or thawed      | `frozen`, `reason`, `actor`, `changedAt`            |

`freeze.updated` carries **both** directions on one subject. `VERBS` holds no honest past tense for un-freezing, and more to the point: a consumer subscribed to a freeze-only subject would raise the alarm and never learn it was cleared. Idempotency key is `ledger.freeze:<changedAt>`, and `changedAt` comes from the database's `now()` — two replicas disagreeing about the wall clock must not be able to disagree about the order the platform was halted and resumed in.

`tx.posted` is emitted **after** commit, never inside the transaction. A consumer must never observe a transaction that could still roll back: at-least-once delivery of a fact that happened beats at-most-once delivery of one that might not have. Idempotency key is `ledger.tx:<txId>`.

**Consumes** — nothing. The ledger is the bottom of the stack; it reacts to no one.

## Ledger

This service _is_ the ledger, so rather than recipes it invokes, here is what it enforces. Every recipe in `@intafaced/ledger-client` passes through `post()`.

| Invariant                                           | Enforced where                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Σ debits = Σ credits, per asset                     | `assertValidPost` (shared with the reference impl)              |
| `available` never negative (except `treasury`)      | service check on locked rows **+** `accounts_non_negative_ck`   |
| Locks funded from the owner's own available balance | `assertPairedLocks`                                             |
| Entry amounts strictly positive                     | `assertBalanced` **+** `ledger_entries_positive_ck`             |
| Idempotency — a retry returns the original          | `ledger_tx_idempotency_idx` unique index                        |
| Hash chain unbroken                                 | `chain_tip` `FOR UPDATE` + `verifyChain`                        |
| A frozen ledger accepts no new posts                | `posting_freeze` read under that same `FOR UPDATE`              |
| `owner_id` is from the space `owner_type` declares  | `assertOwnerIdentifierSpace` **+** `accounts_owner_id_space_ck` |

Enforced in three layers on purpose: shared pure validation, the transaction, and database CHECK constraints. **A bug in this service still cannot create money.** There is a test that proves it, by trying to write a negative balance with raw SQL.

### Who an account belongs to

`owner_type` says what role an owner plays. It now also fixes which **identifier space** `owner_id` is drawn from, because it was the only thing in the row that could:

| `owner_type`                | `owner_id` must be                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`, `subaccount`        | a lowercase canonical UUID — `identity.users.id` / `sub_accounts.id`   |
| `module`,`house`,`treasury` | a namespaced platform slug — `fees:trade`, `rail:card-sandbox`, `mint` |

Before `0005_owner_identifier_space.sql`, `owner_id` was `text` and took either. That is only interesting because of what the 2026-08-02 ADR accepted: the vendored product's money controllers keep their business logic and have their balance writes redirected here through an adapter, and their member ids are `bigint`. An adapter that passes the wrong one **does not fail** — it opens a second, individually conformant account for the same human. Both sum to zero, both hash-chain, both reconcile, both are non-negative; every gate reports clean and no query over this book can tell. It is a dual book, arriving through the door the ADR was written to close.

Not modelled as a separate namespace column, deliberately: a namespace supplied by the caller is supplied by the same caller that supplied the wrong id, so `ns='member'` would arrive alongside `1042` and the pair would be accepted. The space has to be something the ledger already knows.

The constraint also refuses an uppercase UUID. `550E8400-…` and `550e8400-…` are one human and two rows under `accounts_identity_purpose_idx` — the same failure in different clothing.

### Account boundaries

`treasury` accounts are the seam with the outside world and the only ones permitted to run negative. A negative balance there is exactly our obligation:

| Boundary         | Negative balance means                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `rail:<rail>`    | value users have deposited and we custody |
| `venue:<venue>`  | user value sitting at an external venue   |
| `bridge:<chain>` | value bridged to the Protocol Plane       |
| `mint`           | IFC in circulation                        |

---

## Concurrency

Every post takes `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the singleton `chain_tip` row **before** reading any balance it will write. That lock establishes a total order over all posts by itself, which is why the transaction runs at **READ COMMITTED** rather than SERIALIZABLE: transactions queue on the lock instead of aborting one another.

This was measured, not assumed. Under SERIALIZABLE, 50 concurrent posts aborted each other faster than the retry budget could absorb (`40001` storm). Queuing is correct _and_ predictable.

**Consequence:** posting throughput is globally serial — one transaction at a time, platform-wide. Accepted at soft-launch volume.

> **§13 socket — chain sharding.** When posting rate becomes the constraint, shard the chain per asset (independent `chain_tip` rows) with a periodic cross-shard anchor transaction. The hash-chain guarantee narrows from "one total order" to "one total order per asset, anchored", which is sufficient for audit. `hashTx` and the reconciliation replay are already per-transaction and need no change.

---

## Reconciliation

Runs on the owner-published `RECONCILE_CRON_MINUTES` cadence (blank / unset refuses boot — never invent 60; owner may set 60), and on demand via `POST /operator/reconcile` (`admin:treasury` + MFA). apps/admin reaches that path only after edge proxies it — until then the live answers are the scheduled job and a direct call to this service. Three independent checks:

1. **`reconcileBalances`** — cached `accounts.balance` vs a full replay of `ledger_entries`. Catches a bug in the posting path.
2. **`verifyChain`** — every hash recomputed from its predecessor. Catches tampering, _including by someone with database access_.
3. **`totalsByAsset`** — every asset must net to exactly zero across all accounts. Catches value created or destroyed by any means.

On failure the service **freezes itself** and emits `reconciliation.failed`. That is §4.2's requirement: a book we cannot verify must not accept more writes while someone decides what to do about it.

### The one denormalisation

`accounts.balance` is a cache of the entry sum, so a balance read is O(1) rather than a table scan. It is written only inside the same transaction as its entries, and check (1) above is what earns it the right to exist. Per the agent protocol, a balance-shaped column is a doctrine violation _unless_ it comes with a documented reconciliation job. This one does.

---

## Kill-switch

`ledger.posting` in the admin console, or `LEDGER_POSTING_ENABLED=false`.

**Effect when off:** every `post()` throws `ledger.frozen`; reads continue to work. This halts all value movement across the entire platform — trading, payments, escrow, staking, rewards. It is the most consequential switch in the OS and exists because §4.2 demands it.

`ledger.reconciliation` disables the scheduled job only. It does not disable the freeze-on-failure behaviour.

### The switch is durable

It lives in `ledger.posting_freeze` — one row, like `chain_tip`, holding `frozen`, `reason`, `actor` and `changed_at`. It is not a field on a service object, because a freeze is a fact about **the ledger**, not about a server. In memory it lost three ways: a restart resumed posting on a book reconciliation had halted, a second replica never heard about the freeze at all, and the operator's reason was written nowhere.

`post()` reads that row **inside the same `chain_tip … FOR UPDATE` transaction it already takes** — a join on the singleton, so no extra round trip. Placement is not an optimisation: read it any earlier and there is a window between "not frozen" and `COMMIT` in which an operator freeze lands while a post sails through it. Under the lock, freeze and post are ordered by the same mechanism that orders posts against each other. `FOR UPDATE OF t` locks only the tip — taking a row lock on the kill-switch would make the operator's freeze queue behind the posts it is trying to stop.

A retry of a transaction that **already committed** still returns the original while frozen. The value moved; telling the caller otherwise would have it retry a movement that already happened.

Every freeze and thaw is attributed. The database refuses `frozen = true` with neither reason nor actor (`posting_freeze_attributed_ck`) — whoever finds the platform halted must be able to find out why and by whom.

### `LEDGER_POSTING_ENABLED` vs the database

**The database wins, in one direction only.** The asymmetry is the safety property:

| Flag                           | Database says | Result                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LEDGER_POSTING_ENABLED=false` | not frozen    | **freezes**, durably, actor `env:LEDGER_POSTING_ENABLED` |
| `LEDGER_POSTING_ENABLED=false` | frozen        | left alone — the existing reason is the one that matters |
| `LEDGER_POSTING_ENABLED=true`  | frozen        | **stays frozen** — the flag can never thaw               |

The flag defaults to `true`. If a restart honoured it, every deploy, OOM kill and autoscaler event would silently resume posting on a book that reconciliation halted — which is exactly the bug this design removes, arriving back through the front door. An unfreeze is a deliberate act with a named actor; a default-valued environment variable is not one, and must never be able to impersonate one.

Applied once at boot (`LedgerService.applyStartupPolicy`), never per request.

---

## Running it

```bash
docker compose up -d
pnpm --filter @intafaced/svc-ledger db:migrate     # runs as svc_ledger, which owns the schema
pnpm --filter @intafaced/svc-ledger test           # conformance suite vs real Postgres
pnpm --filter @intafaced/svc-ledger dev
```

Migrations run as the schema's **owner**, not an admin role — this role deliberately holds no database-level `CREATE`, so a migration physically cannot reach outside `ledger` (§2).

## Tests

`postgres-ledger.test.ts` runs `runLedgerConformance` from `@intafaced/ledger-client/testing` — **the same suite the in-memory reference runs.** If the two ever disagree, one is wrong and the suite decides which (§4.4).

Beyond conformance it proves what only a real database can: CHECK constraints rejecting direct SQL, 18-decimal round trips, tamper detection, drift detection, and 50 concurrent posts leaving the chain intact. Skips cleanly when Postgres is unreachable.

`owner-identity.test.ts` proves the other two things a client-side suite cannot. First, `accounts_owner_id_space_ck` refuses a vendored `bigint` member id against a **raw INSERT**, with `ledger-client` out of the picture — an adapter bridging a Java stack is the least likely caller in the OS to route through a TypeScript library, so application-only enforcement would be bypassable by exactly the thing it exists to stop. Second, it runs migration `0005` against a table that **already has rows**, in each of the four shapes it can meet: conformant (changes nothing), an uppercase UUID (canonicalised, 18dp balance preserved), a never-used wrong-space row (reclaimed), and one that holds value or appears in the journal (**refuses, naming the row**). A constraint added ahead of its backfill passes on an empty database and stops a deploy on a real one. It also asserts, case for case, that the CHECK and `isValidOwnerId` give the same answer — two copies of one rule in two languages, so the drift is caught here rather than as a 500 on a money path.

`service.freeze.test.ts` builds **two `LedgerService` instances over separate connection pools** against one database and asserts that a freeze on one refuses a post on the other, survives a third instance starting cold, and is attributed to `reconciliation` when the reconciliation job sets it. A test that only asserted `freeze()` set a field would pass against the bug it exists to catch.

Freeze is a `LedgerService` method and deliberately **not** on the `LedgerClient` interface, so it is not in the conformance suite. `LedgerClient` is what every calling service codes against — widening it would hand svc-trade a method to halt the platform, and promise the in-memory reference a durability guarantee it cannot honour.
