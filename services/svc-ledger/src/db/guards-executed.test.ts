/**
 * THE GUARDS NOTHING EVER EXECUTED.
 *
 * D5 sweep. Every database-level guard in `svc-ledger`, checked for a test that
 * actually makes it refuse something. Four came back with no such test — and the
 * reason it looked covered is worth writing down, because the same illusion will
 * form again.
 *
 * `schema-drift.test.ts` mentions all of them. That test builds the database from
 * `drizzle/*.sql` and from `schema.ts` and requires the two to be identical, so it
 * proves each constraint EXISTS and is described consistently. It is an excellent
 * gate and it is not this one: a constraint can exist, be named correctly in both
 * descriptions, and still refuse nothing, because `CHECK (true)` is a valid CHECK.
 * Existence is not enforcement.
 *
 * That distinction has already cost this repo twice — #1039 (the no-double-send
 * guard executed by no test) and #1040 (a NATS container CI ran for months with
 * nothing connected to it). Both were found by asking of a guard: what runs it?
 *
 * The four here:
 *
 *   · `ledger_entries_asset_id_fk` — the ENTRIES half of #1044, which had no
 *      coverage of any kind. #1044's own claim is that "value could exist in an
 *      asset the ledger had never heard of"; it was proven for `accounts` in
 *      `asset-registry.test.ts` and never for `ledger_entries`, which is the
 *      table the value is actually recorded in.
 *   · `chain_tip_singleton_ck` — 0000: two rows "would raise the question which
 *      one is true", and the hash chain is built on there being one answer.
 *   · `posting_freeze_singleton_ck` — same argument, on the kill-switch.
 *   · `accounts_purpose_len_ck` — `purpose` is part of the identity index, so its
 *      128-character cap is a bound on a business key, not a display limit.
 *
 * Raw SQL throughout, ledger-client out of the picture — the point of a database
 * backstop is that it holds when the TypeScript path is not the one writing.
 *
 * H8a PG-hard: this file never `describe.skip` / `postgresAvailable`. CI uses
 * TEST_DATABASE_URL (per-run schema via `createTestDb`). Local without that env
 * starts Testcontainers `postgres:16-alpine`. Docker/PG down is a failed suite,
 * not a green skip.
