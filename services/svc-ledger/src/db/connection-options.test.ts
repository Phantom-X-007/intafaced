/**
 * The limits are the point, so the limits are asserted.
 *
 * This service opens its own pool rather than using `createDb`, and in doing so
 * inherited none of that helper's defaults — including the statement timeout it
 * documents as "money paths should fail fast, not hang". Without it, one wedged
 * query holds the `chain_tip` lock and every value movement in the OS queues
 * behind it indefinitely.
 *
 * A setting that lives inline in `index.ts` cannot be tested without booting the
 * service, which is why it went unnoticed. It lives in its own module now for
 * exactly one reason: so a future edit that drops it fails here.
