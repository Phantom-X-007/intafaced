/**
 * COMPOSE SECRET PARITY — every secret a service refuses to boot without is
 * actually supplied to that service's container.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is a short story with two identical halves.
 *
 * `svc-ledger` merges `authEnvSchema`, so `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` is required with
 * no default. Its block in `docker-compose.apps.yml` never set it. The service
 * crash-looped on `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET: Required` (#431).
 *
 * The interesting part is not the missing line. It is WHY nobody noticed for so
 * long: **a running container keeps the environment it started with.** The
 * fleet was healthy, `docker ps` was green, and the defect was latent until an
 * unrelated `up` recreated the container. A secret that is missing but not yet
 * fatal is invisible until the next deploy — which is to say, it surfaces at the
 * worst possible moment, during a change, while somebody is looking at something
 * else.
 *
 * That is not a bug you fix once. It is a bug you make impossible. Writing this
 * check found the second one immediately: `svc-academy` merges
 * `internalServiceEnvSchema` and its compose block supplied only the edge
 * secret. Same defect, same latency, not yet triggered.
 *
 * It then found it a THIRD time. That gap was fixed by #442, and reverted 26
 * minutes later by an unrelated merge; this gate caught the revert on a rebase
 * a day afterwards, when nothing else had. See FIXED_IN_OPEN_PR below — that
 * sequence is the argument for this file existing.
 *
 * It matters most during a ROTATION. Rotating a shared secret means editing
 * every consumer; getting three of four is the same failure with a worse blast
 * radius, and the fourth service will not tell you until it restarts. See
 * docs/SECRET-ROTATION-READINESS-2026-08-03.md for the blast-radius map this
 * check mechanises.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, stated so the green line is not read as more than it is:
 *
 *   · It never reads a secret's VALUE, and never asserts one is set — `${VAR:?…}`
 *     already makes compose refuse to start for that. It asserts only that the
 *     WIRING exists: schema requires it, compose passes it.
 *   · It covers SECRET-SHAPED names only (see `SECRET_VAR`). A required
 *     `DATABASE_URL` absent from compose crash-loops identically and is invisible
 *     here. The name of this file is `compose-SECRET-parity` for that reason.
 *   · Both sides are read with regexes, not with a TS parser and a YAML parser.
 *     The requirement side fails toward MISSING a requirement (a false negative);
 *     the compose side fails toward seeing FEWER supplied variables (a false
 *     alarm). Neither direction can invent a green tick out of a real gap, and
 *     the zero-comparison guard at the bottom refuses the degenerate case where
 *     a parse stops matching entirely.
 *   · `env_file:` is not read. Nothing in this compose file uses it today; a
 *     service that started to would show up as a false alarm, not a false pass.
 *
 * Exit 0 = every required secret is wired. Exit 1 = a service would crash-loop
 * on its next container recreate, is in no compose block at all, or a parse
 * stopped matching and nothing was actually compared.
