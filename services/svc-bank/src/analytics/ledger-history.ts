/**
 * READ PORT over the ledger's transaction history.
 *
 * Spend analytics is a PROJECTION. §8.1 gives svc-bank "views + rails", and a
 * spend breakdown is the clearest case of a view: it is derived, on demand,
 * from movements that already exist in the book. The alternative — svc-bank
 * maintaining its own `spent_this_month` counters, updated on every event —
 * would be a second source of truth for money in everything but name, and would
 * be wrong the first time an event was replayed or missed.
 *
 * The `LedgerClient` interface does not expose history (it exposes balances and
 * single-transaction lookups), so svc-bank declares the narrow read it needs
 * here rather than widening a shared interface every service would then have to
 * implement.
 *
 * §13 SOCKET: the production adapter needs a `ledger.history` procedure on
 * svc-ledger, which is a `packages/contracts` + svc-ledger change and therefore
 * its own PR (§15.2, AGENT_PROTOCOL §1 — the contract lands before the caller).
 * `HttpLedgerHistory` in `../ledger-client.ts` is written against that shape and
 * fails loudly rather than returning an empty answer if it is not there yet — an
 * analytics view that silently reports zero spending is worse than one that is
 * unavailable.
