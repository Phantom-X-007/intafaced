# Work recovery — full program + peace-of-mind findings

**Run date (UTC):** 2026-08-03T05:37Z (fetch) · **Tip re-checked through** `origin/main` **`7f8b9d0`** (#421 trading rewire on tip)  
**This supersedes the thinner first pass** (`WORK-RECOVERY-AUDIT-SPEC-AND-FINDINGS-2026-08-03.md`) for conclusions; both kept for trail.

---

# A · Enhanced prompt (what you actually needed)

## Implicit requirements (inferred)

1. **Emotional + operational peace of mind:** prove we did not silently delete Nitro FE value.  
2. **Completeness:** every place work can hide is checked (not a 3-minute sample).  
3. **Correct truth base:** **GitHub `origin/main`**, not a stale/dirty laptop checkout.  
4. **Distinguish** “not in git history as that commit” vs “behavior still on main under squash/rewrite.”  
5. **Bizzan alignment:** do not rescue work that **rebuilds** what the kit already is; rescue only **our** honesty/wiring/i18n/brand.  
6. **Intentional supersession ≠ loss:** Denon may **replace** a screen with “not built” for doctrine — that must be named, not treated as accident.  
7. **Deferred ≠ lost:** residual/AFK board items are backlog, not recovery emergencies.  
8. **Actionable output:** named RESCUE / SAFE / DROP / DEFER / SUPERSEDED lists — no vague “looks fine.”  
9. **Failure-hunting:** document how each method can lie (squash, tree-diff on old bases, dirty regression).  
10. **You don’t run git** — agent owns hunt + plain summary.

## Completeness bar (Definition of Done for this audit)

| # | Gate | Met this run? |
| - | ---- | ------------- |
| G1 | `git fetch --prune` + pinned tip SHA | **Yes** `7f8b9d0` |
| G2 | **All** remote branches scanned for shell/apps/web history delta | **Yes** (7 shell / 3 apps/web) |
| G3 | **All** local branches scanned for shell history delta | **Yes** (46) |
| G4 | `git cherry` patch-id pass on FE-related locals + all remote shell candidates | **Yes** |
| G5 | **Content probes** for high-stakes markers on main (not cherry alone) | **Yes** (with caveats) |
| G6 | Worktrees: dirty shell **or** patch-unique shell commits | **Yes** (10) |
| G7 | Stash empty? | **Yes** empty |
| G8 | Open PRs + Nitro closed-unmerged sample | **Yes** |
| G9 | Residual register open/partial/blocked named | **Yes** (from main) |
| G10 | Local dirty classified rescue vs regression | **Yes** |
| G11 | Untracked docs split (session vs bulk noise) | **Yes** |
| G12 | Bizzan “don’t rebuild” applied to rescue advice | **Yes** |
| G13 | Intentional #421 supersession of Withdraw/Recharge named | **Yes** |
| G14 | External `sovereign-worktrees` checked | **Yes** (docs-only path) |

**Still cannot prove from one Mac:** work only on Denon’s disk never pushed; pure chat-only “fixes.”

# B · Architecture of the audit (plan before trust)

```
Phase 0  Pin truth     → fetch, tip SHA, open PR snapshot
Phase 1  Enumerate     → every remote/local ref with path history ≠ main
Phase 2  De-ghost      → git cherry (patch-id) + PR merged list
Phase 3  Content prove → distinctive strings / file roles on origin/main
Phase 4  Local machine → dirty tree, stash, worktrees, untracked
Phase 5  Backlog       → residual-register statuses
Phase 6  Classify      → SAFE / RESCUE / SUPERSEDED / DEFER / DROP / REGRESSION
Phase 7  Report        → this doc + one-screen for Nitro
Phase 8  Act (later)   → only RESCUE with human/agent go
```

### Method lies we actively combat

| Lie | Why it happens | Countermeasure used |
| --- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| “Branch has 14 commits not on main” | **Squash merge** rewrites SHAs | `git cherry` + content markers + merged PR titles |
| “Tree differs by 60k lines” | Branch **base is old**; whole folder diverged | Don’t use raw `diff main:path ref:path` alone for “unique work size” |
| “Local has important Vue edits” | Checkout **behind** + undoing craft | Diff vs **origin/main**; craft on main, local removes → REGRESSION |
| “Withdraw craft gone = agent failed” | **#421** replaced custody screens on purpose | Read file + commit message |
| “Cherry says unique ⇒ missing feature” | Markers in **docs evidence JSON** not runtime | Prefer runtime paths + feature probes |
| “No remote branch ⇒ safe” | Branch **deleted after merge** | Path history on main (`ix-trade.js`, #421) |
| “Empty stash ⇒ no WIP” | WIP in **worktrees** | Worktree scan |

---

# C · Exhaustive enumeration results

## C1 · Remote branches with shell history not reachable from `origin/main`

**Complete set (7):**

| Remote branch | Hist commits | `git cherry` unique shell-related | Content / disposition |
| ------------- | -----------: | -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `origin/fix/pr86-format-and-wave` | 5 | Many pre-#86 era commits still “+” by patch-id | **Mostly historical stack**; chart/TV/port-gate may be **partially absorbed** into later main (Exchange comments cite 350px clip; lightweight-charts + TradingView **attribution** on main). **Not a bulk re-merge candidate.** |
| `origin/feat/rebrand-english-black-orange` | 4 | Overlaps #86-era stack | **#86 landed** as consolidated squash long ago. **SQUASH/HISTORICAL.** |
| `origin/fix/vendor-shell-build` | 2 | **+** only `.dockerignore` commit (`c9e9d4f`); other cherry `-` (already equivalent) | **RESCUE:** `.dockerignore` **still absent** on `origin/main` |
| `origin/fix/vendor-shell-purge-legacy` | 1 | **+** full purge commit | **RESCUE (Denon brand):** not on main |
| `origin/feat/vendor-shell-rewire-promo` | 1 | **+** WIP | **QUARANTINE** — author says NOT reviewed/verified |
| `origin/feat/app-i18n-keys` | 1 | **+** i18n + `shell-i18n-scan.mjs` | **RESCUE (Nitro FE):** scan tool **0 hits** on main; real unique |
| `origin/feat/spine-java-rename` | 1 | **+** package rename WIP | **Not FE product** — Denon/spine; do not touch as FE rescue |

**Remote branches with apps/web history delta (3):** spine-scope, spine-otc wip, pr86-format — **not FE shell program**; no Nitro rescue.

**Recently deleted remotes (after merge):**  
`feat/vendor-shell-rewire-otc-cms` · `feat/vendor-shell-rewire-trading` → content on main as **#418**, **#421**.

## C2 · Local branches with shell history delta

**46** local branches. After `git cherry` + content checks:

- **~25** = history delta but **no patch-unique shell** → **SQUASH_GHOST** (merged via squash; keep folder cleanup for later).  
- **~15** showed cherry “+” but **content probes / main log / feature probes** show **ON_MAIN** or **rewritten by later merge** (AFK #406–408, sub-accounts, hotkeys, dual-book on MoneyIndex, CMDK, groupPlate, etc.).  
- **wave-a-continue** (14 cherry+): mix of OK on main + weak markers; **not** treated as a lost 14-commit product — many landed via #267 and follow-ons; remaining gaps are **craft detail**, not “missing program.”

## C3 · Worktrees

**10** worktrees with shell dirty **or** cherry-unique shell commits — all dirty_shell=0; unique counts mirror local branch ghosts/false positives. **No dirty shell WIP found in worktrees.**  
External `~/projects/sovereign-worktrees`: docs-frontend-operating-plan only.

## C4 · Stash / open PRs / closed unmerged

| Surface | Result |
| ------- | ------ |
| Stash | **Empty** |
| Nitro open PRs | **None** |
| Open repo PRs | #423 notify · #422 custody-scan java · #420 tracker money risks · #346 Shehzad pay |
| Nitro closed unmerged (sample 100) | **#334** board-clear GO docs only |

## C5 · Local main checkout (this folder)

| Fact | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| Behind origin by **100+** commits (was 156 earlier; tip moved with #418/#421) | **Stale** — not truth |
| Dirty Vue (Withdraw, Register, …) | Vs origin: **REGRESSION / wrong base** — main’s Withdraw is **CustodyNotBuilt** (27 lines); local dirt is not a secret better product |
| Untracked session docs (BIZZAN map, this family) | **Optional docs RESCUE** |
| ~188 untracked docs | **Do not bulk commit** |

## C6 · Residual register (deferred by design — from main)

| Status | Count | Role |
| ------ | ----: | ---- |
| done | 27 | Shipped |
| partial | 9 | Finish later |
| open | 9 | AFK uc/ident/intafaced/index/cmdk/help/whitepaper/appdownload/rescan |
| blocked | 2 | B11 chart entry · C-LWC panes |
| waived | 1 | B15 multi-monitor |

→ **DEFER board**, not “lost off GitHub.”

---

# D · Critical narrative: #421 and “lost” withdraw craft

**On `origin/main` tip, `Withdraw.vue` is intentionally:**

```text
CustodyNotBuilt — no chain custody endpoint; wallet RPC unadopted until security review.
```

Same pattern for other custody screens. Commit **#421** states the **vendor workflow is preserved in git history** and returns when a real custody service exists.

**Pre-#421** Withdraw was ~1200 lines including B3 dual-book craft (`ix-dualbook`, `feeSourceLabel`, …).  

| Interpretation | Correct? |
| -------------- | -------- |
| “Nitro’s withdraw craft was never committed” | **False** — it was on main before #421 |
| “It’s gone from tip forever with no recovery” | **False** — full file in history (`7f8b9d0^`) |
| “We should immediately put B3 craft back on tip” | **No** — would **lie** about custody while ADR says no wallet RPC yet |
| “Use Bizzan withdraw Java flow as live money UI” | **No** — dual-book / Option B |

**MoneyIndex** on tip **still** carries B3/desk dual-book honesty and edge balance source — not all craft was wiped.

---

# E · Final classification (complete for action)

## E1 · SAFE_ON_MAIN (do not re-rescue)

Examples proven by presence on tip / probes:

- Trading rewire **#421** (`ix-trade.js`, Exchange edge path, empty≠broken)  
- OTC/identity/inbox rewire **#418**  
- Nav/auth gates **#419**  
- Shell deploy **#412** family  
- Dual-book / ix-* honesty on **MoneyIndex**, plane switch, hotkeys, CMDK, sub-accounts, AFK honesty strings, book-honesty, chart empty states, TradingView **attribution** + 350px-clip **lesson in comments**, residual register tooling  

**Unspoken answer:** the FE **program** is on GitHub.

## E2 · RESCUE (real, off tip)

| ID | Item | Owner | Why real | Action |
| -- | ---- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| **R1** | `feat/app-i18n-keys` + `tooling/ci/shell-i18n-scan.mjs` | Nitro FE | Scan file **absent** on main | Rebase on tip → PR |
| **R2** | `05_Web_Front/.dockerignore` (`c9e9d4f`) | Infra/FE | **Missing** on main after #417 | Small PR |
| **R3** | `fix/vendor-shell-purge-legacy` | Denon | Brand purge not on tip | Denon PR / coordinate |
| **R4** | Session docs (maps, call extracts, this audit) | Nitro | Untracked knowledge | Optional docs PR |

## E3 · QUARANTINE

| ID | Item | Rule |
| -- | ---- | ---- |
| **Q1** | `feat/vendor-shell-rewire-promo` | Keep branch; **no merge** until review |
| **Q2** | `feat/spine-java-rename` / spine wips | Not FE; leave |

## E4 · SUPERSEDED (in history, not tip — correct)

| ID | Item | Why |
| -- | ---- | --- |
| **S1** | B3 full Withdraw dual-book UI | Replaced by **CustodyNotBuilt** (#421) for doctrine |
| **S2** | Similar recharge custody UI if collapsed to NotBuilt | Same |
| **S3** | Pre-#86 rebrand branch stacks | Landed via #86 squash |

**Recover later:** when wallet RPC cleared + ledger withdraw path exists — **rebuild from history + edge**, don’t re-open Java money UI.

## E5 · REGRESSION_DIRTY (this Mac)

Discard local dirty Vue on stale main when moving to clean worktree. **Do not commit.**

## E6 · DEFER (residual board)

All residual **open/partial/blocked** rows → FE board input for Chat D. Named in C6.

## E7 · DROP

- `apps/web` as product  
- Bulk 188 untracked research docs  
- Re-merging entire `rebrand-english-black-orange` / pr86 historical branches  
- Rebuilding Bizzan screens from Next

# F · Bizzan rule (applied)

| Bizzan already is | We do not rescue as “rebuild” | We may still add |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Auth, OTC, exchange shell, admin | New parallel apps | Honesty, i18n keys, edge rewire, brand purge |
| Custody **workflows** in history | Live Java wallet UI | CustodyNotBuilt until review |
| Charts host | Third full chart product this week | Data honesty; TV later if chosen |

---

# G · Peace-of-mind one-screen (Nitro)

| Worry | Verdict |
| ----- | ------- |
| Did most of my shell work never hit GitHub? | **No — it’s on main** (or squash-merged). |
| Is this laptop the source of truth? | **No — it’s stale + dirty. Trust `origin/main`.** |
| Anything important only local? | **i18n branch is on GitHub remote** (not main). **Docs** untracked. Dirty Vue = **bad**, not secret gold. |
| Withdraw craft “deleted”? | **Superseded on purpose by #421** (honest “not built”); full craft in **history**. |
| Deferred work lost? | **No** — residual register. |
| Denon trading/OTC rewires? | **On main** (#418, #421). |
| Must-rescue now? | **i18n PR · dockerignore · Denon purge · optional docs.** |

---

# H · Self-prompt for execution agents (copy-paste)

```
WORK RECOVERY EXECUTION — not a skim.

Truth: origin/main after fetch. Tip must be re-read.
Read docs/WORK-RECOVERY-PEACE-OF-MIND-2026-08-03.md end-to-end.

Do:
1) Confirm tip still has #421 Withdraw=CustodyNotBuilt; do not re-apply B3 withdraw craft on tip.
2) RESCUE R1: rebase origin/feat/app-i18n-keys onto origin/main, open PR, conflict-check vs #421 files.
3) RESCUE R2: PR adding vendor/.../05_Web_Front/.dockerignore from c9e9d4f if still missing.
4) Message/PR path for purge-legacy only with Denon ownership note.
5) Never merge promo WIP. Never commit dirty stale main Vue.
6) Bizzan rule: no apps/web product; no rebuild of kit screens.

Prove: gh pr urls + git grep shell-i18n-scan / .dockerignore on main after merge.
```

# I · What the first pass under-did (honesty)

| Gap in first pass | Fixed here |
| ----------------- | ---------- |

| Said withdraw craft “on main” from older tip | **Corrected:** craft was on main, then **superseded** |
| Under-specified method lies | Section B table |
| Implicit needs not spelled | Section A |
