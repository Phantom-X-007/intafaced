/**
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A REAL CHAIN, REALLY FORKED, AND THE ROWS THAT MUST NOT SURVIVE IT
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * This is the file the rest of svc-indexer exists to make possible.
 *
 * The reorg design — versioned rows, provenance on every write, repair by DELETE
 * — has been asserted since the service was written, but only ever against
 * `MemoryChainSource`: a fake whose hashes this repository computes, whose forks
 * this repository stages, and which therefore cannot disagree with the code in
 * any way the code did not anticipate. That proves the projection matches the
 * design. It does not prove that a chain behaves the way the design assumed.
 *
 * Here the fork is genuine. `evm_snapshot` / `evm_revert` make anvil DISCARD
 * blocks it has already published — blocks this indexer has already read,
 * projected and served — and the blocks mined afterwards occupy the same heights
 * with different hashes, because their transactions and timestamps differ.
 * Nothing is staged on our side: the node really does start answering
 * `eth_getBlockByNumber` with a different hash at a height we have written rows
 * for. That is exactly the shape that silently corrupts a naive projection, and
 * it is the shape nothing in this repo had ever actually produced.
 *
 * ── Why this runs against its own chain ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `evm_revert` rewinds the whole NODE. svc-protocol's live suites deploy
 * contracts to the shared `evm` service and read them back; if these two ran
 * concurrently — and `pnpm verify` runs package tasks in parallel — this file
 * would rewind svc-protocol's factory out of existence mid-test, and svc-protocol
 * would go red for a reason nobody could find in its own diff. So this suite
 * addresses `evm-reorg` (port 8546) and touches nothing else.
 *
 * ── Both stores, same scenario ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The same reason the conformance suite runs twice. `unwindTo` is a DELETE and
 * `prune` is a DELETE with a correlated subquery — SQL that looks right and is
 * off by one row. The memory store is short enough to check by eye, so running
 * both against the same real chain is the check.
 *
 * Skips without a chain (named leftover, same class as pay `evm-chain.live`);
 * hard-fails on CI where `REQUIRE_EVM_CHAIN=1`. Chain-down is not PG-down.
 * When the chain is up, the Postgres half is H8a-hard: `TEST_DATABASE_URL` or
 * Testcontainers `postgres:16-alpine`. Docker/PG down throws; it does not skip-green.
