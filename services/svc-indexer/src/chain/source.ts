/**
 * THE `ChainSource` PORT — the only thing this service reads from.
 *
 * Everything downstream of here (projection, reorg repair, the read API) is
 * written against this interface and nothing else, which is what makes the
 * reorg behaviour testable at all: a real chain will not fork on demand, and a
 * design whose central property can only be observed in production is a design
 * nobody has checked.
 *
 * ── There is deliberately no EVM implementation in this PR ──────────────────
 *
 * SOCKET §13 (`socket.evm-rpc`). There is no EVM RPC anywhere in this stack —
 * svc-protocol already records the same gap (its `PROTOCOL_RPC_URL` points
 * outside the compose network and a clean clone has none), and there are no
 * deployed CLOB contracts for an adapter to read. Writing one now would mean
 * inventing event signatures for contracts that do not exist and shipping a
 * mock behind a production-looking name. The socket is declared instead; the
 * port is the shape the adapter must satisfy, and `MemoryChainSource` is the
 * reference implementation its conformance is judged against.
 *
 * ── The one demand this port makes of any implementation ────────────────────
 *
 * **Events carry absolute state, never a delta.** A `book_level` event says
 * "the total resting at this price is now X", not "add X". A `position` event
 * says "this account's size is now X". Two properties fall out of that and
 * nothing else buys both:
 *
 *   · re-applying a block is a no-op, so idempotency is structural rather than
 *     a dedupe table someone can forget to consult
 *   · unwinding a reorg is a delete of the newer version, with no compensating
 *     arithmetic to get wrong
 *
 * A chain that only emits deltas is not excluded — it means its adapter must
 * reduce them to absolute state before yielding a block. That reduction is the
 * adapter's problem precisely because it is the part that needs the chain's own
 * state reads to be correct.
