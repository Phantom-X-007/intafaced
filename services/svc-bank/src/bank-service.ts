 * policies, instructions and records of completed jobs. It stores no balance,

 * every "how much" question they answer goes to `LedgerClient`, and nothing in
 * this service writes a figure that a later read could mistake for one.
 *
 * The composition root is one function so the wiring is visible in one place —
 * including that `SpendAnalytics` gets a READ port over the ledger and no
 * writer at all.
