/**
 * The thing that makes §9 tracing real.
 *
 * Every service in this repo already writes spans — `withMoneySpan` in each
 * `src/tracing.ts`, tagging `intafaced.money_path=true` so the collector's tail
 * sampler keeps money at 100% (tooling/infra/otel-collector.yaml). The
 * collector, Tempo, Grafana and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` were all already
 * wired. One piece was missing, and it is the piece that matters:
 *
 *   `@opentelemetry/api` on its own is a NO-OP.
 *
 * With no registered TracerProvider, `trace.getTracer()` hands back the no-op
 * tracer, `startActiveSpan` runs the callback, and the span is discarded before
 * it reaches a wire. Every span this platform has ever produced went nowhere.
 * That is not a degraded mode you can see on a dashboard — it looks exactly
 * like a healthy service that nothing has happened in yet. This module
 * registers the provider, so the spans already being written arrive in Tempo.
 *
 * ## Why a TracerProvider and not `NodeSDK` + auto-instrumentations
 *
 * `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node` patches Fastify / `postgres` /
 * NATS by intercepting CommonJS `require`. This repo is `"type": "module"`, and
 * in ESM those patches only apply when the process is started with the loader
 * hook (`--import @opentelemetry/instrumentation/hook.mjs`). Shipping the
 * auto-instrumentation packages without that flag would reproduce the exact
 * failure being fixed here: dependencies installed, wiring apparently present,
 * nothing emitted. Manual spans need no patching, and manual spans are where
 * the money is. Auto-instrumentation is a separate change that must land with
 * the loader flag and a test that proves a Fastify span exists.
 *
 * ## Failure posture
 *
 * Telemetry must never take down a money service. A collector that is down, a
 * DNS failure, a full export queue — all of it is the SDK's problem and is
 * reported through the diag channel, never thrown into a caller's request. The
 * one thing this module DOES insist on is flushing on shutdown: a batch
 * processor holds spans in memory, so a service that exits without flushing
 * loses its final batch — including, on a bad day, the last ledger post before
 * the crash you are trying to explain.
