/**
 * THE UNIQUE INDEX ON OPEN POSITIONS SAYS `status = 'open'`, AND IT MEANS IT.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT WAS FOUND
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `0003_trade_futures_positions.sql:50`:
 *
 *     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX positions_open_unique_idx
 *       ON trade.positions (user_id, market_id, side, margin_mode)
 *       WHERE status = 'open';
 *
 * Migrations `0008` / `0009` added a FOURTH status, `closing` — the dark-feed
 * freeze from `docs/adr/2026-08-07-futures-exit-when-the-feed-is-dark.md` — and
 * left that predicate alone. So:
 *
 *     Alice opens a long on BTC-PERP
 *       → the feed goes dark
 *       → she closes; the row freezes to `closing`
 *       → the feed returns
 *       → she opens a SECOND long on BTC-PERP, and it succeeds.
 *
 * `listOpen` then returns two rows: `['closing', 'open']`.
 *
 * `#1103`'s migration `0015` reviewed this very index and wrote a paragraph
 * about it — but only about the `margin_mode` column, concluding correctly that
 * the column is harmless. Nobody looked at the predicate. The FIRST test below
 * is that reproduction, run through the real service.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE DECISION: THE PREDICATE STAYS. THE INVARIANT WAS ALWAYS NARROWER THAN THE
 * INDEX'S NAME SUGGESTS, AND `0016` NOW SAYS SO IN THE SCHEMA.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The tempting fix is `WHERE status IN ('open', 'closing')` — "one LIVE position
 * per (user, market, side, margin_mode)". It is the wrong fix, for one reason
 * that is already settled law here and three that are measurable.
 *
 * **The settled one.** A `closing` row exists for exactly one reason: OUR feed
 * went dark while a trader was trying to leave. ADR 2026-08-07 ruled that *the
 * platform's outage is not the trader's risk*, and that *a control which traps
 * funds is not a safety control*. Tightening the predicate would charge our
 * outage to the trader a second time: locked out of that market and side until
 * a feed we broke comes back. There is no automatic settlement tick — a
 * `closing` row settles only when someone calls `close()` again and a usable
 * mark exists — so the lockout has no bound the trader controls. That is the
 * same trap the ADR was written to remove, rebuilt one layer down in storage.
 *
 * **Measured, not assumed** — the three hazards a tightened predicate would be
 * guarding against do not exist in this codebase, and the tests below check each:
 *
 *   1. *Double-counted margin.* Isolated margin only (`0015`). Each position
 *      holds its own ledger pot `position:<id>`, drawn from the same finite
 *      `userAvailable`. The second open must FUND itself — asserted below by
 *      balance, not by status code. Row count is not the binding constraint on
 *      exposure; the trader's balance is, and it is unchanged by this carve-out.
 *   2. *Confused liquidation.* `sqlLiquidationPositionLoader` filters
 *      `status = 'open'`, so the `closing` row is never scanned. The new `open`
 *      row is evaluated against its own isolated margin, alone.
 *   3. *Confused funding.* `sqlFundingPositionLoader` filters `status = 'open'`
 *      too, so the frozen row accrues nothing — ADR done-bar item 4.
 *
 * Nothing in `svc-trade` resolves a position by `(user, market, side)`; every
 * read, lock, ledger key and idempotency key is by position id. Two rows on one
 * market and side are therefore two independent settlements, not one ambiguous
 * one.
 *
 * **The trade-off accepted.** A trader CAN, during a long outage, cycle
 * close→open→close→open and accumulate several frozen rows on one market and
 * side. That is real and it is the price of this decision. It is bounded by
 * their own free balance — each open posts fresh margin — and each frozen row
 * settles independently against a profit pot whose bound is re-read live at
 * every close, so N small settlements drain it exactly as one large one would.
 * The alternative price was trapping a trader in a market because of our
 * outage, and this repo has already ruled which of those two it will pay.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * REVERT PROOF
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each of these was RUN, not reasoned about; the counts are measured.
 *
 * · Tighten the predicate to `IN ('open','closing')` via a later migration — 6 of
 *   7 red. The reproduction fails with `duplicate key value violates unique
 *   constraint "positions_open_unique_idx"` on the trader's new open, which is
 *   the lockout of the header, observed rather than argued.
 * · Drop `positions_open_unique_idx` — 3 red, including `two OPEN rows are still
 *   refused`: the invariant that IS real stops being enforced.
 * · Put `closing` back into `sqlLiquidationPositionLoader` — 1 red (`the
 *   liquidation scan never sees the frozen row`). Same for the funding loader,
 *   1 red. Those two filters are PRECONDITIONS of the carve-out, not unrelated
 *   details, and this is what says so.
 * · Revert migration `0016` — 1 red, and it is the LAST test in this file, the
 *   one that checks the comment exists. Stated plainly rather than dressed up:
 *   `0016` is documentation as DDL, so the only assertion it can break is the
 *   assertion that the documentation is there. Every BEHAVIOURAL test in this
 *   file passes with `0016` absent. The tests are the guard; the migration is
 *   the reason, parked where the next reviewer will trip over it.
 *
 * H8a PG-hard: this file never `describe.skip` / `postgresAvailable`. CI uses
 * TEST_DATABASE_URL (per-run `createTestDatabase`, not shared table mutations).
 * Local without that env starts Testcontainers `postgres:16-alpine`. Docker/PG
 * down is a failed suite, not a green skip.
