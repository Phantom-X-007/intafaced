/**
 * crypto-native — §6.1's real v1 adapter, and §13's "crypto-native is real from
 * day one".
 *
 * It accepts on-chain assets and settles them into the ledger. There is no
 * partner in the flow of funds, which is why this rail works on day one while
 * every card rail waits on a sponsor.
 *
 * ON A CHAIN, "AUTHORIZE" AND "CAPTURE" ARE NOT WHAT THEY ARE ON A CARD.
 *
 * A card authorization is a promise the issuer can be held to; capture is when
 * the money actually moves. A chain has no such split — there is no hold, and
 * nothing to complete. A transfer either has not landed, or it has landed and
 * is irreversible once it is deep enough.
 *
 * So this adapter maps them honestly rather than pretending:
 *
 *   authorize → "a transfer to this payment's acceptance address has reached
 *                `minConfirmations`". Under the threshold the answer is
 *                `pending`, because a shallow transaction can still be
 *                reorganised away, and treating it as authorized is precisely
 *                how a merchant ships goods against a payment that unwinds.
 *   capture   → an accounting act. The value is already ours; capture is the
 *                moment the core is told to book it. It re-checks finality
 *                rather than trusting a decision made minutes ago.
 *
 * If this crashes between the two, nothing is stranded: the funds are on-chain
 * at an address we control, `capture` is derived from chain state rather than
 * from adapter memory, and the ledger post it triggers is keyed on the payment.
 * Re-running produces the same answer.
