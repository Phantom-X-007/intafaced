# Running Stream A (exchange shell on :8090)

This is the **vendored Vue 2 / iView shell** at `vendor/*/05_Web_Front`.  
It is **not** `apps/web`. Agents boot and prove it; Nitro is never the test runner.

Law: [`FRONTEND-OPERATING-PLAN-2026-07-30.md`](FRONTEND-OPERATING-PLAN-2026-07-30.md).

## One command (preferred)

From a **worktree** (never the main checkout):

```bash
pnpm ui:boot
```

What it does:

1. If something already answers on `http://127.0.0.1:8090/`, **reuses it** and exits 0.
2. Otherwise spawns `npm run dev` in the shell **detached** (does not hang the agent).
3. Waits until **both** `GET /` and `GET /app.js` return 200 (webpack can serve HTML before the bundle is ready).
4. Writes log + pid under `.artifacts/uiproof/`.

Override port:

```bash
PORT=8091 pnpm ui:boot
```

## First time in a worktree

### Node 18 for the shell (required)

The shell is **webpack 3 / 2018**. It dies on Node 20+ (`No such module: http_parser`).  
The monorepo may use a newer Node; Stream A boots with a **local Node 18**:

```bash
mkdir -p .tools && cd .tools
curl -fsSL https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.20.5/node-v18.20.5-darwin-arm64.tar.gz | tar -xz
mv node-v18.20.5-darwin-arm64 node18
# boot.mjs looks for .tools/node18/bin/node automatically
# or: export STREAM_A_NODE="$PWD/node18/bin/node"
```

`.tools/` is gitignored. One install per machine/worktree.

### Shell dependencies

The shell keeps its own `node_modules` (webpack 3 / npm, not the monorepo pnpm tree).

If `pnpm ui:boot` exits 1 saying `node_modules missing`, run the command it prints:

```bash
cd vendor/*/05_Web_Front
PATH="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.tools/node18/bin:$PATH" npm ci
pnpm ui:boot
```

`npm ci` can take several minutes on a cold tree. That is a deliberate visible step — the boot script will not install for you.

## Proof (after PR-2)

```bash
pnpm ui:proof
```

Produces `.artifacts/uiproof/PROOF.md` and screenshots. That file is the definition of “the UI works,” not a human opening localhost.

## Rules agents must not break

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Never `npm run dev` in the **foreground** of a chat turn | Freezes the session (see `STREAM-A-UNSTICK-CONTINUE.md`) |
| Never claim visual “done” without `PROOF.md` (or say **unverified**) | Unfalsifiable glances are forbidden |
| Backends-down is a valid fixture for Phase 1 | Honesty bar / empty states are the product |
| Do not invent prices | S2 waits on market seed #109 |
| Auth-gated `/uc/*` empty vs error is **unproven** until an auth fixture | Pass 3 of the operating plan |

---

## Ports

| Port | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| **8090** | Stream A shell (this doc) |
| 8080 | webpack default if `PORT` unset — do not use for proof |
| 3000 / 3100 / 4000 / 4014 | Platform apps / edge / ws — not Stream A |

---

## Manual fallback (humans only, not the gate)

```bash
cd vendor/*/05_Web_Front
PORT=8090 npm run dev
# open http://127.0.0.1:8090/ — elective taste only, never certification
```
