/**
 * svc-p2p — PEER-TO-PEER TRADING WITH ESCROW (§6.2).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE ONE THING THIS FILE IS FOR
 *
 * Locked funds must always reach exactly one terminal state. Not usually. Not
 * after an operator intervenes. Always, including when the process dies at the
 * worst possible instruction.
 *
 * Two properties do the work, and everything else is bookkeeping around them:
 *
 *   1 · **DECIDE, THEN POST.** A terminal decision is written and committed to
 *       `p2p_trades.resolution` BEFORE the ledger post that acts on it. The
 *       database allows exactly one resolution per trade
 *       (`p2p_trades_resolution_matches_status_ck`), so "released to both
 *       parties" is not a race to lose — it is a row that cannot be written.
 *       Crash between the decision and the post and the funds are *late*, not
 *       stranded: `sweepSettlements()` finds `resolved_at IS NOT NULL AND
 *       settled_at IS NULL` and re-posts, and every recipe is keyed on the
 *       trade id so re-posting moves nothing twice.
 *
 *   2 · **RE-DRIVE, DON'T INTERROGATE.** "Did the escrow lock post?" is
 *       answered by calling `escrowLock` again. Its business key
 *       (`p2p.escrow.lock:<tradeId>`) makes a retry return the original
 *       transaction if it did, and fail on funds if it did not. So a trade
 *       stuck in `created` is never ambiguous, and — critically — a refund is
 *       never posted against an escrow that was never funded. That matters
 *       because escrow is pooled per (user, asset): a spurious refund would not
 *       fail, it would quietly pay the seller out of somebody else's trade.
 *
 * Doctrine §0.6: this service holds no balances. `p2p_trades.amount` is the
 * quantity that was locked, recorded once and never mutated. The value itself
 * is in the ledger's `escrow` account kind, and `escrowIntegrity()` proves the
 * two agree.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 * ruling") reached a `catch`, was thrown away, and surfaced as an assertion
 * failure in another branch's test run that named nothing at all.

 * `settled_at` is stamped by the database (`SET settled_at = now()`), and the
 * two properties this service exists to guarantee both compare against it:
 * "decide, then post" means `resolved_at <= settled_at`, and
 * `sweepSettlements()` orders the decisions it has to re-drive by `resolved_at`.
 * Reading `new Date()` for one side of those comparisons and `now()` for the
 * other put an unbounded skew term into an ordering that value depends on — a
 * Node clock a few milliseconds ahead of the server's is enough to record a
 * decision as having happened AFTER the movement it authorised, which is an
 * audit trail that contradicts itself.
 *
 * It also does not survive a second replica. Two svc-p2p processes each stamp
 * `resolved_at` from their own hardware, so the sweeper's FIFO becomes an
 * ordering over two clocks that were never synchronised. Postgres is the one
 * clock every replica already shares, so every instant on the row comes from
 * here — not just the two the test happens to compare.
 *
 * `now()` is the TRANSACTION timestamp, not the statement timestamp, and that
 * is deliberate:
 *
 *   · Within one transaction it is a constant, so `resolveDispute` stamps the
 *     trade's `resolved_at` and the dispute's `resolved_at` with the identical
 *     instant. One ruling happened at one moment; two rows disagreeing about
 *     when a moderator decided would be the audit-trail hole all over again.
 *   · Across transactions it still gives strict ordering where we need it.
 *     `settled_at` is written by a LATER, separate transaction — the decision
 *     has committed before the ledger post is even attempted — so its
 *     transaction timestamp is strictly greater. `clock_timestamp()` would buy
 *     no extra strictness here and would cost the constant above.
 *
 * The truncation is also in the safe direction: the driver parses Postgres'
 * microseconds down to JS millisecond precision, so a value read here and bound
 * back into a column is always <= the true transaction timestamp, never past it.

  /**
   * THE QUEUE. Open disputes, most overdue first.
   *
   * Two things about this method are load-bearing and neither is the SELECT:
   *
   *   1 · **It stamps what it serves, in the same statement.** A row can only
   *       leave here if `last_seen_by_moderator_at` was written for it — the
   *       final SELECT reads out of the UPDATE's RETURNING, not out of the
   *       page CTE, so "served but unrecorded" is not a state this code can
   *       produce. That stamp is the only fact in the schema that distinguishes
   *       "we shipped a queue endpoint" from "a human reached this dispute",
   *       and the first one is a claim about our repo rather than about the
   *       world.
   *
   *   2 · **The order is the SLA.** `deadline_at ASC` over `status = 'open'` is
   *       exactly `p2p_disputes_open_idx`, which existed from the first
   *       migration and which, until this method, nothing queried. An escalated
   *       dispute keeps its original (now past) deadline precisely so it stays
   *       at the top of this list instead of being pushed down by the re-arm.
   *
   * Keyset pagination on `(deadline_at, id)`: an offset would let a dispute
   * resolved mid-page shift a later one out of view, and "the queue silently
   * skipped one" is the failure this whole exercise exists to end.

/**

 * offset would let one of those shift a dispute past a page boundary and out of
 * view entirely. "The queue skipped one" is the exact failure this whole
 * surface exists to end.
 *
 * The obvious keyset cursor is `<deadline>|<id>`, and it is wrong here for a
 * reason worth writing down. Postgres describes `$n::timestamptz` as a
 * timestamptz parameter, so the driver serialises whatever it is given THROUGH
 * A JS DATE — which holds milliseconds, while the column holds microseconds. A
 * cursor built from the last row therefore lands a fraction of a millisecond
 * BEFORE that row, and every page repeats its predecessor's last entry. A
 * queue that repeats is the same broken promise as one that skips, arrived at
 * from the other side. (`.799344+00` went in; `.799+00` was compared.)
 *
 * So the timestamp never leaves the database. The cursor carries the id, and
 * the ordering key is looked up server-side at full precision. An unknown id
 * yields an empty page rather than an error — dispute rows are never deleted,
 * so the only way to present one is to have invented it.
