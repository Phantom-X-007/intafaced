/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * PER-RUN DATABASE — isolation for services whose SQL is schema-qualified
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `createTestDb` above isolates by SCHEMA. That only works when the service's
 * SQL is search_path-relative, because the generated schema has a name nobody
 * can predict (`test_ledger_4711_1`). svc-pay, svc-trade and svc-bank write
 * `pay.merchants`, `trade.markets`, `bank.spaces` — fully qualified, on purpose
 * (§2: a service physically cannot reach outside its own schema). Their SQL
 * cannot run inside a schema called anything else, which is exactly why
 * `bank-service.test.ts` documented schema isolation as unavailable to it and
 * stayed on the shared `bank` schema instead.
 *
 * The unstated assumption in that reasoning is that the isolation boundary has
 * to be the schema. It does not. Give the run its own DATABASE and create the
 * service's REAL schema name inside it: `trade.markets` resolves, every
 * migration applies verbatim, and no production statement changes by a
 * character. Two worktrees running the same suite now truncate different
 * `trade.orders` tables in different databases.
 *
 * Why this and not "make the production SQL schema-agnostic": stripping the
 * qualification makes every production query depend on the connection having
 * `search_path` set correctly. That trades a test-harness problem for a
 * production one, in three services that move money, two of which are owned by
 * a human on a claimed mountain. The cost here is instead ~130 ms of
 * `CREATE DATABASE` per suite file, paid once.
 *
 * The `assertTestDatabase` guard from #211 is not weakened. It runs twice: once
 * on the ADMIN connection, which must itself be a `*_test` database before we
 * are willing to issue `CREATE DATABASE` from it, and once on the per-run
 * database. Both ask the server for `current_database()`, so a lying URL is
 * still caught.
