/**
 * i18n BYPASS RATCHET — the `copy = {}` queue, counted and frozen.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. `apps/web` does not use `@intafaced/i18n`. Every surface
 * declares a local `const copy = { … } as const` of English strings, each one
 * introduced by the same comment: "Placeholder for the i18n system being built
 * in a separate worktree." That worktree landed. The placeholder did not go
 * away, and — this is the part that matters — it became the pattern that every
 * new screen copies, because it is what the neighbouring file does.
 *
 * That is the failure mode this file exists to stop. Not the 164 strings that
 * are already there; the 165th.
 *
 * WHY A GATE AND NOT A MIGRATION. Moving the existing strings into the catalog
 * is not the mechanical job it looks like, for two reasons that are worth
 * writing down so nobody re-litigates it from scratch:
 *
 *   1. There is nothing to move them INTO yet. `@intafaced/i18n` is a pure data
 *      + function package with no React binding: no provider, no `useT()`, no
 *      locale negotiation in the Next.js request path, no way for a user to
 *      choose a language. Migrating today means inventing that adoption layer
 *      first, and that is a feature with a design, not a cleanup.
 *   2. English is the only catalog, and the standing instruction is English
 *      only. So the migration buys a user exactly nothing today, while touching
 *      164 strings — 24 of them in the order ticket, 27 in the protocol plane,
 *      11 in sign-in. Money-adjacent copy is product law. A "confirm withdrawal"
 *      that changes wording in transit is a real loss, and the odds of 164
 *      hand-moves being word-perfect are not good.
 *
 * So: freeze it, count it, and make the number only go down. This is not a TODO
 * pointing at "later" (§14.8) — the queue is enumerated below with exact counts,
 * it is enforced on every `pnpm verify`, and it cannot grow.
 *
 * HOW TO SHRINK IT. Key a file's strings into `packages/i18n/src/catalog.ts`,
 * render them through a translator, delete the `copy` object, and lower or
 * remove the file's row here. The scan tells you the exact number to write.
 *
 * Exit 0 = the queue is at or below baseline. Exit 1 = it grew, or a baseline
 * row is stale.
 *
 *   node tooling/ci/i18n-bypass-scan.mjs
 *
 * Related: `pnpm scan:i18n` is the fuzzy JSX-literal heuristic and stays
 * advisory. This one counts a specific named binding, so it has no false
 * positives and can block.

/**
 * THE QUEUE. Every file that still hardcodes copy, and how many strings it
 * holds. Frozen 2026-08-03 at 15 files / 164 strings.
 *
 * A file absent from this map may not have a `copy` object at all. A file
 * present may not have more strings than its number. Both directions are
 * enforced — a stale row that reads higher than reality is the same kind of
 * dishonesty this whole change is about.
 *
 * **EMPTY SINCE 2026-08-04, and that is a deletion, not an achievement.** All 15
 * rows were `apps/web` files and the directory was deleted with the one-surface
 * ADR. The 164 strings were not keyed into `@intafaced/i18n`; they went away with
 * the app that held them, so this queue draining to zero says nothing about
 * whether the product is translatable.
 *
 * The scan still runs and the queue is now CLOSED: any `.ts`/`.tsx` file under a
 * scanned root that introduces a `copy` object is a new bypass and fails. What it
 * does NOT cover is the product surface, which is Vue under `vendor/` and outside
 * this walk — the shell keys its copy through `assets/lang/`. Reading a green
 * result here as "the product has no hardcoded copy" is exactly the inference
 * this file exists to prevent.
