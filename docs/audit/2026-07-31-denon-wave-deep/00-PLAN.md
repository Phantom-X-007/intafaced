# 00-PLAN — Denon money/spine deep audit (backend only)

**Realign 2026-07-31:** Operator interrupted frontend/ADR drift. This fire is **audit · review · debug · fix · stress** on **services/packages** only. **No vendor Stream A / frontend.**

**Tip:** `2dc706b` (#251 money-class closed — do not re-judge #226–#228 unless regression)
**Prior closed:** money-class mega archive `docs/audit/2026-07-31-money-class-mega/`
**Gap named in STATUS:** full adversarial money pass on Denon **#201–#218** never done (WAVE only)
